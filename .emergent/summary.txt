The previous AI engineer successfully brought the WEPO project from its initial MVP state to a more robust and secure application. The work focused on three major areas: enhancing the messaging system, implementing a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus, and revolutionizing the Masternode network.

Initially, a critical security audit revealed a false claim of End-to-End Encryption (E2E) in the messaging system. The AI engineer addressed this by modifying  and  to remove server-side decryption, use RSA for key exchange, and ensure true client-side decryption. This involved multiple fixes and thorough backend and frontend testing.

Following this, the focus shifted to implementing a true hybrid PoW/PoS consensus. The engineer updated  to support 3-minute PoS blocks and 9-minute PoW blocks post-activation (Block 131,400), utilizing a stake-weighted random validator selection and timestamp-based block priority. Backend and frontend tests confirmed the core functionality, though a minor issue with a staking info endpoint was noted for future work.

Finally, the Masternode system was revamped. Previously, masternodes earned fees without providing services. The AI engineer implemented 5 genuine services (Transaction Mixing, DEX Relay, Network Relay, Governance, Vault Relay) and updated  and  to reflect these functionalities, including device-specific runtime requirements (9h for computers, 6h for mobile). Documentation (, , ) was extensively updated throughout these phases to reflect the completed work and newly identified pending tasks. The trajectory concluded with a re-organization of audit files into a new  folder for better continuity.

The WEPO project aims to be a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency, emphasizing financial freedom through a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus and Masternodes. Core features include a secure wallet with a 16-word seed, quantum resistance via Dilithium signatures (though currently simulated), and a feeless messaging system that *must* be truly end-to-end encrypted. Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization is a key component, supporting asset creation, DEX trading, and requiring WEPO balance.

The tokenomics dictate a no-burn fee redistribution model (60% to Masternodes, 25% to Miners, 15% to PoS Stakers) from a fixed total supply of 69,000,003 WEPO. A community-mined genesis block is planned. The application features a unified wallet for WEPO and BTC, an AMM exchange, and a Quantum Vault offering zk-STARK-protected private storage and Ghost Transfers for WEPO and RWA. The PoW mining schedule is designed for ~20 years: 10% of total supply (6.9M WEPO) to be mined in the first 18 months (6-min blocks, constant reward), with PoW continuing alongside PoS/Masternodes at a 9-minute block time and specific 3, 6, 3, 3-year halving phases. PoS is activated at block 131,400 with 3-minute blocks, stake-weighted random validator selection, and timestamp-based block priority. Masternodes must earn their 60% fee by providing actual services like BTC/WEPO/RWA mixing, DEX relay, network relay, governance, and vault relay, with minimum runtime requirements (9h for computers, 6h for mobile).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed the implementation and initial testing of the **Revolutionary Masternode Service System**. This involved a comprehensive rewrite of the frontend component () to support device-specific requirements and a one-click launch experience. On the backend, a new file () was created, and  was updated with new API endpoints to manage masternode registration, status, and service provisioning. These changes ensure that masternodes now provide 5 genuine services (Transaction Mixing, DEX Relay, Network Relay, Governance, Vault Relay) to justify their 60% fee allocation, transforming them from rent-seeking to value-providing entities.

Following the successful frontend testing of the masternode system, the AI engineer's most recent activity focused on **extensive documentation updates**. This included:
1.  Updating the main  to reflect the new E2E messaging and the detailed functionality of the revolutionary Masternode network, including service descriptions and device-optimized runtime requirements.
2.  Updating the  (which was subsequently moved) to mark the Masternode Services as REVOLUTIONIZED and PoS Consensus as IMPLEMENTED.
3.  Crucially, a new **critical issue was documented**: Wallet Creation/Login Flow - Authentication Issue, noting that wallet creation prevents dashboard access, making it a high-priority fix for future work. This issue was added to the critical findings, detailed analysis, and recommendations sections.
4.  The  was also updated to reflect these changes.

The very last actions involved a **major restructuring of the audit and operational documentation**. The existing  and  were moved into a new  folder. Additionally, several new documentation files were created within this folder: , , ,  (for the new folder), and . The user's final instruction was to include details about adjusting WEPO collateral for masternodes/PoS based on WEPO value and halving schedules, and to confirm the self-custodial nature of the wallet routing masternodes. This indicates the immediate context is focused on establishing comprehensive operational and strategic documentation for future development.

The next step is to populate the newly created  folder with the strategic details requested by the user, specifically regarding WEPO collateral adjustments for Masternodes/PoS and confirming self-custodial wallet routing.
