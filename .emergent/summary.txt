The previous AI engineer successfully established the WEPO project from scratch, integrating quantum resistance, RWA tokenization, and a complex tokenomics model. Initially, the focus was on fixing frontend RWA and authentication issues, followed by advanced P2P network testing and critical security fixes, boosting the security score from 56.2% to 95.3%. A dynamic masternode collateral system was implemented. The work then progressed to the Community-Mined Genesis Block, culminating in the successful development of the Community Mining Software. Following this, the user pivoted the direction towards integrating BTC functionality into a unified wallet, which necessitated a major architectural cleanup by removing redundant wallet types. The current task involves unifying the WEPO-BTC and WEPO-RWA exchange functions into a single interface, demonstrating an iterative, user-driven development process with continuous refactoring and feature consolidation.

The WEPO project began as a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency with hybrid PoW/PoS consensus and Masternodes, emphasizing financial freedom. Core initial features included 16-word seed recovery, username/password login, BTC-to-WEPO Atomic DEX, and PoS/Masternode options, alongside privacy features (zk-STARKs, Ring Signatures, Confidential Transactions) and HTLC-based Atomic Swaps.

Subsequent user requests led to significant evolutions:
1.  **Quantum Resistance**: Integration of Dilithium signatures and a no-fee universal quantum messaging system.
2.  **RWA Tokenization**: Ability to create Real World Assets with DEX trading, including a WEPO balance requirement and a creation fee.
3.  **Tokenomics Overhaul**: No-burn fee redistribution (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers) and a phased mining schedule.
4.  **Community-Mined Genesis Block**: Technical framework and community mining software for a decentralized launch.
5.  **Unified Wallet**: Consolidate multiple wallet types (Regular, Quantum, Unified) into a single WEPO wallet capable of managing both WEPO and Bitcoin, eliminating complex atomic swaps in favor of internal exchanges.
6.  **Quantum Vault**: Transform the Quantum Wallet into a Quantum Vault for private, zk-STARK-protected WEPO storage, with an Auto-Deposit feature for all incoming funds to enhance default privacy.
7.  **Unified Exchange Interface**: Consolidate all trading functionalities (BTC-WEPO and RWA-WEPO) into a single, comprehensive exchange page.

The application uses a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a custom Python-based blockchain utilizing SQLite.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**



**Key Files and Their Importance (with recent changes):**

-   : Main React application entry. **Significantly refactored** to remove multi-wallet selection logic, streamlining the user flow to a single wallet setup and dashboard. It now uses  directly.
-   : Central user interface. **Crucially updated** to consolidate features, integrate BTC wallet displays, and incorporate the new  component. It previously had conditional rendering for different wallet modes and RWA/DEX tabs, which are now unified. Quantum-related imports and logic were removed during cleanup.
-   : **Newly created** component for the Community-Mined Genesis Block, displaying countdown and mining stats.
-    (renamed to ): Initially handled BTC-WEPO atomic swaps. **Extensively modified and renamed** to become the single  interface, responsible for integrating both BTC-WEPO and RWA-WEPO trading, and updated to use  for API calls instead of relative paths. Quantum-related imports were removed.
-   : Manages wallet state. **Updated** to handle both WEPO and BTC addresses, balances, and transactions within a single context, aligning with the unified wallet approach. Previously managed only WEPO.
-   : **Newly created** utility for standardized frontend address generation and validation (regular WEPO, quantum WEPO, BTC). This centralizes address logic.
-   : Core blockchain logic. **Modified** for dynamic masternode collateral, 3-way fee redistribution, and now imports  for standardized address validation.
-   : Core logic for RWA tokenization. Functions remain stable, handling asset creation and fee collection.
-   : Quantum resistance implementation. Adjusted to return key bytes.
-   : **Newly created** utility for standardized backend address generation and validation (regular WEPO, quantum WEPO).
-   : FastAPI backend. **Heavily updated** to expose RWA, dynamic masternode collateral, governance, and importantly, **community mining API endpoints** (e.g., ). Also, new internal swap endpoints were added, anticipating the removal of atomic swaps. Updated to import and use the backend .
-   : **Newly created** backend component coordinating the community-mined genesis block logic. Fixed to resolve  context issues.
-   : **Newly created** backend file holding endpoints for community mining. Integrated into .
-   : Critical for tracking testing progress and user feedback. Continuously updated with results from backend and frontend tests.

<pending_tasks>
-   Activate Production Staking Mechanism (90% complete, requires final activation).
-   Implement Community-Mined Genesis Block (*Core technical framework and mining software are implemented and tested, but the event is for Christmas 2025*).
-   Anonymous launch via Tor/IPFS.
-   Complete privacy proof generation system.
-   Implement confidential transactions system.
-   Conduct external security audits and penetration testing.
-   Implement the Quantum Vault concept with zk-STARKs (including Auto-Deposit to Quantum Vault for all incoming funds).
-   Finalize and test the Unified Exchange Interface.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the **Unified Exchange Interface**. This task emerged from a user request to consolidate all trading functions (WEPO-BTC and WEPO-RWA) onto a single page for improved user experience and efficiency.

The current approach involves refactoring and extending the existing  component. The  component was already capable of handling both BTC and RWA tabs, making it the most efficient starting point.

The AI engineer has performed the following actions:
1.  **Fixed existing quantum-related references** within  (which were remnants from the previous multi-wallet architecture and  that was removed). This involved resolving linting errors related to undeclared variables and undefined imports.
2.  **Renamed the file** from  to  to reflect its new, broader purpose.
3.  **Updated ** to import and use the newly renamed  component, and to adjust its routing to point to this single exchange interface.
4.  **Updated dashboard button text** to reflect the unified exchange.

The frontend was restarted after these changes. The last observed action was the AI engineer checking for compilation errors in the frontend logs after updating the Dashboard and renaming the exchange component. The logs indicated that the frontend was webpack compiled successfully, but the interface itself was not yet tested in this specific message for its unified exchange functionality.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Test the Unified Exchange Interface's functionality in the frontend to ensure all trading pairs are accessible and working correctly.
