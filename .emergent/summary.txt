The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the WEPO project, integrating quantum resistance (Dilithium) and a universal quantum messaging system by unifying them into the core blockchain and developing necessary frontend components. The work then pivoted to Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, including DEX trading and a crucial economic model. This evolved from simply adding a creation fee to a comprehensive, no-burning fee redistribution system benefiting Masternodes (60%), Miners (25%), and PoS Stakers (15%). Concurrently, the mining reward schedule was significantly revised to a 6-month phased reduction over 18 months (400->200->100 WEPO), followed by a shift to PoS/Masternode rewards. The AI meticulously implemented these complex backend tokenomics, updating blockchain logic, API endpoints, and initial frontend components. Backend tests confirmed the new tokenomics and fee distribution. However, frontend issues, specifically RWA endpoint integration and authentication flow problems, remain, preventing full user access. The immediate focus is resolving these critical frontend and API integration bugs.

The WEPO project aims to be a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency with hybrid PoW/PoS consensus and Masternodes, emphasizing financial freedom via unbreakable privacy (zk-STARKs, Ring Signatures, Confidential Transactions, Masternode Mixing), decentralization, and an anti-establishment ethos. Core wallet features include 16-word seed recovery, username/password login, BTC-to-WEPO Atomic DEX swap, and locked PoS/Masternode options. The project emphasizes quantum resistance (Dilithium) and memory-hard PoW (Argon2), with an anonymous launch via Tor/IPFS. Initial implementation covered core blockchain, P2P, staking, real privacy features, and HTLC-based Atomic Swaps.

The scope expanded to include a quantum resistance overhaul, a no-fee universal messenger, and RWA tokenization. Key additions during the last cycle involved implementing Dilithium signatures for quantum transactions integrated into the main blockchain, a universal quantum messaging system, and RWA tokenization with DEX trading. Critical feedback led to implementing a WEPO balance requirement and a fee (double normal transaction fee) for RWA token creation. This further evolved into a comprehensive fee redistribution policy where all network fees (RWA and normal transactions) are distributed (60% to Masternodes, 25% to Miners, 15% to PoS Stakers) instead of being burned. The mining schedule was revised to a 6-month phased reduction over the first 18 months (400, 200, 100 WEPO/block), followed by PoS/Masternode rewards.

**Key Files and Their Importance (with recent changes):**

-   : Main React application file. Updated to handle session persistence, error handling, and integrate  and conditionally render  or . Contains core authentication flow logic.
-   : Core user dashboard. Modified to include RWA-related buttons (, ), handle navigation to these components, and display quantum information.
-   : Original BTC DEX component. Replaced by  to support multi-asset trading.
-   : **(NEW)** Displays a user's RWA assets. Key for showing owned tokens and initiating RWA swaps. Modified to load RWA data based on  and integrate actual RWA components.
-   : **(NEW)** UI for creating new RWA tokens. Crucially updated to display WEPO balance requirements, calculate and show RWA creation fees, and disable the creation button if funds are insufficient.
-   : **(NEW)** Replaces  to provide a unified trading interface for both BTC-WEPO and RWA-WEPO atomic swaps.
-   : Central blockchain logic. **Crucially modified** to implement the new 6-month mining reward schedule, manage the 3-way fee redistribution (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% Stakers) by modifying the coinbase transaction creation and  methods. Includes helper methods for active masternodes and stakers.

<current_work>
The WEPO project is currently undergoing a major tokenomics overhaul and RWA tokenization integration.

**1. RWA Tokenization (Backend Complete, Frontend Integration Pending):**
-   **Core Implementation**: A new  module was created to handle RWA asset creation, including the collection of RWA creation fees.
-   **Economic Mechanism**: RWA token creation now requires a WEPO balance and costs double a normal transaction fee. This fee is collected into a redistribution pool instead of being burned.
-   **Frontend**:  and  components were created and integrated into the .  now dynamically displays the fee and disables the create button if the user has insufficient balance.  was replaced by  to support multi-asset (BTC/RWA) trading.
-   **Current Status**: Backend testing for RWA asset creation and fee collection is fully successful. However, there are pending frontend issues, specifically with  and a general  that prevents users from accessing the RWA Dashboard, as indicated by recent testing agent summaries.

**2. Comprehensive Tokenomics Overhaul (Backend Complete, Frontend Reflection Pending):**
-   **Mining Schedule**: The mining reward schedule was updated in  to a 6-month phased reduction for the first 18 months (400 WEPO/block for months 1-6, 200 WEPO for months 7-12, 100 WEPO for months 13-18). After 18 months, rewards transition to PoS and Masternode incentives.
-   **Fee Redistribution**: A crucial architectural decision was made to *never burn* any network fees. Instead, all fees (normal transaction fees and RWA creation fees) are now collected and immediately distributed per block based on a simple 3-way split: 60% to active Masternodes (split equally), 25% to the current Block Miner, and 15% to active PoS Stakers (proportional to stake).
-   **Technical Implementation**:  was heavily modified to update block reward calculations and implement the 3-way fee distribution within the coinbase transaction and transaction mempool processing.  and  were updated to correctly route fees to this new redistribution system. New API endpoints were added in  to expose tokenomics information.
-   **Documentation**: The  was updated to comprehensively reflect these new tokenomics, including the mining schedule, fee distribution policy, and the total supply allocation breakdown (28.8% mining, 47% PoS, 18.8% Masternode, 5.5% Dev/Ecosystem).
-   **Current Status**: Backend testing confirms the new mining schedule and the 3-way fee distribution system are working correctly. The frontend updates to reflect these changes are in progress, but the authentication flow issue is currently blocking further UI verification.

The project is at a critical juncture where core backend tokenomics are robust, but frontend accessibility and full integration of RWA components require immediate attention to enable user interaction.
