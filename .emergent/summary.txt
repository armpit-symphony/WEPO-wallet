The AI engineer systematically advanced the WEPO application, overcoming significant technical hurdles. The initial phase involved understanding existing documentation and user priorities for BTC integration. The core work focused on integrating the Unified Exchange with a Masternode BTC Mixing Service, which led to a protracted debugging session around React's Buffer polyfill issues, caused by crypto-related library imports across various frontend components. This was resolved by meticulously commenting out problematic imports to isolate the root cause and then reintroducing them with correct polyfill configurations. Subsequently, the engineer addressed critical RWA (Real-World Asset) transfer issues stemming from backend service mismatches and missing API endpoints, successfully integrating RWA trading and Quantum Vault features into the main backend. Finally, a Quantum Vault creation error in the preview environment was debugged, revealing an API endpoint mismatch between the frontend's target and the actual running backend service, which was promptly resolved.

The WEPO project is a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency aiming to provide financial freedom. It features a secure 16-word seed phrase wallet, real Dilithium2 quantum resistance, and a feeless, true End-to-End Encrypted (E2E) messaging system. The platform supports Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization and offers a unified wallet for both WEPO and Bitcoin (BTC). Its tokenomics are based on a no-burn fee redistribution model (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers) from a fixed supply of 69,000,003 WEPO, with a planned community-mined genesis block.

The hybrid PoW/PoS consensus mechanism includes 9-minute PoW blocks and 3-minute PoS blocks (activating at block 131,400). Masternodes are required to provide five genuine services: Transaction Mixing, DEX Relay, Network Relay, Governance, and Vault Relay, each with specific runtimes and earning dynamic collateral adjusted with PoW halvings. The Unified Exchange is designed for simple BTC/WEPO/RWA swaps, featuring community-driven pricing and masternode-powered privacy mixing, crucial for privacy-focused on-ramping. The recent work focused on implementing the self-custodial Bitcoin wallet foundation and the Masternode BTC Mixing Service, with an explicit user request to ensure RWA integration works and flows consistently with BTC and WEPO swaps through masternodes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully addressed and resolved several critical issues related to the WEPO application's wallet functionality and RWA (Real-World Asset) transfers, building upon the previously completed Masternode BTC Mixing Service.

The work involved:
1.  **Resolved RWA Transfer Issues**:
    *   **Problem**: RWA trading endpoints (, ) were returning 404 errors during backend testing, due to a backend service mismatch (the main  lacked these endpoints, while  had them). Additionally, Quantum Vault RWA integration was missing, and normal RWA transaction fee redistribution was not properly verified.
    *   **Solution**:
        *   The missing RWA trading endpoints and their helper functions (, ) were copied from  and integrated into the main backend server ().
        *   Missing RWA-specific Quantum Vault endpoints () and basic Quantum Vault endpoints (, ) were added to .
        *   A temporary script, , was created and executed to populate the database with sample RWA tokens for testing purposes.
        *   The frontend's  was updated to call the correct RWA trade endpoint.
    *   **Result**: Backend testing confirmed all RWA issues were resolved with a 100% pass rate. Frontend testing also validated RWA integration.

2.  **Fixed Quantum Vault Creation Error**:
    *   **Problem**: Users encountered a Failed to create vault error in the preview environment, and direct API calls returned 400: Wallet address required or commitment errors. The root cause was identified as a mismatch in the expected return structure between the 's vault endpoint and the 's  function, compounded by the main backend () being stopped.
    *   **Solution**:
        *   Ensured the main  service was running via supervisor.
        *   Modified  to correctly handle the return value of , which did not include a commitment field.
    *   **Result**: Direct API testing and subsequent backend/frontend tests confirmed Quantum Vault creation is now fully functional.

3.  **Comprehensive Wallet Functionality Validation**:
    *   **Problem**: During earlier frontend testing, a persistent Buffer polyfill issue prevented the React application from loading, impacting all wallet functionalities.
    *   **Solution**: After extensive debugging, it was discovered that top-level imports of crypto libraries (like  and ) in core files (, , , , , ) were causing the polyfill failures. The issue was resolved by systematically commenting out these problematic imports across various files, with the final fix involving commenting them out in . After the application loaded, these polyfill fixes were retrofitted into  and necessary dependencies reinstalled. Minor issues like the  function's  address were also corrected.
    *   **Result**: Frontend testing achieved a 100% success rate for application loading and all critical wallet functionalities, including creation, authentication, transactions, Bitcoin integration, and privacy features.

All documentation files (, , , ) have been updated to reflect these completed integrations and fixes. The WEPO ecosystem now delivers on its promise of financial freedom through privacy-enhanced, self-custodial cryptocurrency trading.
