The AI engineer's trajectory commenced with a request to create a security test for a decentralized crypto application. The process began with extensive code exploration of the existing codebase, including , , , , and  files to understand the application's architecture and security posture.

Following this, the AI engineer proposed a detailed three-tier security testing strategy (API-only, API+messaging, Full) and recommended the Full scope, which the user approved. A  script was then developed and executed, generating a JSON report. The initial test run revealed critical security gaps: missing global rate limiting, inadequate input validation, weak password enforcement, unavailable blockchain sanity endpoints, and a local messaging E2E dependency issue.

The AI engineer then proceeded to fix these issues incrementally, securing user approval for each major step. Steps 1 (Global Rate Limiting) and 3 (Blockchain Sanity Endpoints) were successfully implemented and re-verified. Step 2 (Input Validation and Password Strength) was also fixed and passed. The final pending task is the re-verification of Step 4 (TRUE E2E messaging), which the engineer is poised to execute following the user's latest approval, before moving to frontend testing. The work has been systematic, with clear communication and testing at each stage.

The user's primary requirement is to enhance the security of an existing decentralized crypto application, which features privacy, private messaging, PoW, PoS, Masternodes, and a quantum vault. The initial task was to understand the codebase by reviewing , , , , and  files, and then to create a comprehensive security test suite before the application goes public.

The AI engineer developed a  () to address this, offering three testing scopes (API-only, API + local messaging, Full) and recommending the Full scope (Option C). This suite was designed to test HTTP security headers, CORS, brute-force/lockout, global/endpoint rate limiting, input validation (XSS/Injection), weak password rejection, read-only blockchain sanity endpoints (, , ), and TRUE E2E messaging locally. The suite generates a . Subsequent work involved fixing identified vulnerabilities: implementing global rate limiting, hardening input validation and password strength, ensuring blockchain sanity endpoints are functional, and resolving a local messaging E2E dependency.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:


-   ****:
    -   Summary: The main FastAPI backend application entry point. It defines API routes and includes middleware for security features.
    -   Changes: Modified to implement robust global rate limiting within its . Also, the  and  endpoints were added to this file to ensure their availability as per the security test requirements.

-   ****:
    -   Summary: Appears to be an active API service handling many live endpoints, potentially acting as a bridge or a separate service for certain functionalities.
    -   Changes: Modified to strengthen input validation and password strength enforcement for the  route. This includes strict regex for usernames, rejection of XSS/injection/path traversal payloads, and  enforcement with early-return 400s. It also already had a global limiter that was left in place.

-   ****:
    -   Summary: Contains utility functions related to security, such as  and potentially password validation logic.
    -   Changes: Not directly modified in the provided trajectory, but its functions like  are invoked and leveraged by other files () for security hardening.

-   ** (New File)**:
    -   Summary: A newly created Python script designed to perform a comprehensive security audit of the application. It fetches the backend URL from , uses  prefixed routes, and supports different testing scopes.
    -   Changes: This file was created from scratch to serve as the primary security testing tool, and was updated during the process to incorporate specific fixes for rate limiting, input validation, and endpoint availability.

-   ** (New File)**:
    -   Summary: The output file generated by , containing a machine-readable report of the security test findings and a weighted security score.

    -   Summary: Core module for the quantum-resistant, TRUE E2E encrypted messaging system.
    -   Changes: No direct code changes, but its functionality was a target for local E2E validation. A missing crypto dependency was flagged initially but later identified as likely a transient issue or misunderstanding of  vs .

-   ****:
    -   Summary: Contains environment variables for the frontend, notably  which specifies the backend API endpoint.
    -   Changes: Not modified, but its value () is crucial for the  script to target the correct backend.

-   **Step 4: TRUE E2E messaging (local module) re-verification**: Confirm that the local messaging E2E test (server cannot decrypt, recipient-only decryption) passes.
-   **Automated Frontend Tests**: Once backend stability and security fixes are confirmed, run automated frontend tests.

<current_work>
Currently, the AI engineer has successfully addressed significant security vulnerabilities identified by the initial prelaunch security suite.

The work completed includes:
1.  **Global Rate Limiting (Step 1)**: Robust global rate limiting middleware has been implemented in  and , enforcing a 60/min limit with appropriate  responses and headers (, , ). This ensures the API is protected from excessive requests.
2.  **Input Validation + Password Strength (Step 2)**: Strict input validation and password strength enforcement have been added to the  route within . This now correctly rejects weak passwords and blocks common attack payloads (XSS, SQL/NoSQL injection, path traversal), significantly hardening the account creation process.
3.  **Blockchain Sanity Endpoints (Step 3)**: The critical read-only blockchain sanity endpoints ( and ) have been confirmed to be available and functional ( with valid payloads) on . The  endpoint also functions correctly.

The primary immediate remaining task is **Step 4: TRUE E2E messaging (local module) re-verification**. This involves re-running the local-only check for the quantum messaging module to confirm that:
*   The server cannot decrypt messages (by design).
*   The sender cannot decrypt recipient messages.
*   Only the recipient can successfully decrypt messages.
An earlier run flagged a missing crypto dependency, but a review suggests that  is installed, implying the issue might have been transient or an oversight. This re-verification will confirm the integrity of the core privacy feature.
