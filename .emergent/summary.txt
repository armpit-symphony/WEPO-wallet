The AI engineer successfully took the WEPO cryptocurrency project from concept to a functional prototype. Initially, the project scope was ambiguous, clarified by the user as building the actual cryptocurrency, not just a website. The engineer adopted an iterative approach, starting with a user-facing wallet prototype and then moving to the core blockchain. Key challenges involved debugging frontend wallet issues (seed phrase generation, balance display) and backend blockchain errors (JSON serialization, transaction hashing). Significant effort was invested in refining the tokenomics based on user feedback, balancing initial buzz with long-term sustainability, culminating in the Option A reward schedule. The trajectory shows a methodical progression of development, troubleshooting, and direct user engagement to meet evolving requirements.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to build WEPO - We the People, a revolutionary, privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency to reclaim financial freedom.

**Core Vision:** To create a borderless, inclusive, and self-sovereign ecosystem, challenging traditional financial systems through privacy, decentralization, and anti-establishment ethos.

**Key Features:**
- **Privacy:** Default and unbreakable using zk-STARKs, Ring Signatures, Confidential Transactions, and Masternode Mixing.
- **Consensus:** Hybrid Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) with Masternodes.
- **Wallet:** Native desktop and mobile wallet featuring:
    - 16-word seed for recovery and username/password login.
    - Built-in BTC-to-WEPO Atomic DEX swap (via HTLCs and Masternodes).
    - PoS and Masternode options, locked until 18 months post-PoW launch.
    - Warning prompts for seed saving and login rules.
    - Must start with zero balance, reflecting real blockchain activity.
- **Tokenomics:**
    - Total Supply: 63,900,006 WEPO.
    - Distribution: 50% (31.95M) via PoW mining, 50% (31.95M) via PoS/Masternode rewards.
    - Mining Reward Schedule (Year 1 - Option A):
        - Q1 (Months 1-3): 400 WEPO/block (10-min block time initially).
        - Q2 (Months 4-6): 200 WEPO/block.
        - Q3 (Months 7-9): 100 WEPO/block.
        - Q4 (Months 10-12): 50 WEPO/block.
    - After Year 1, PoW stabilizes, and Post-20 years, transaction fees redirect to PoS stakers (60%) and Masternodes (40%) for sustainability.
- **Launch:** Anonymous and decentralized via Tor/IPFS, community-mined genesis block.
- **Security:** Quantum resistance (Dilithium signatures), memory-hard PoW (Argon2).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. A separate  directory was introduced for the core cryptocurrency implementation.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   : Main FastAPI backend application. It was updated to integrate with the new  components and handle new API endpoints for blockchain interactions and mining.
-   : Main React component. It was modified to integrate the new wallet components and set up routing for different sections of the WEPO wallet.
-   : Manages the global state of the WEPO wallet, including user authentication, wallet data, and interactions with the blockchain. It was heavily modified for secure BIP39 generation, handling wallet creation, loading, and persistence, and exposing wallet functions.
-   : Component responsible for creating a new WEPO wallet. It was crucial for implementing the secure BIP39 seed phrase generation and the initial user setup flow. It was fixed to use  for randomness.
-   : Contains the core logic for the WEPO blockchain, including block creation, validation, mining difficulty, and the updated mining reward schedule (Option A). It was fixed to handle JSON serialization of byte objects and correct transaction hash calculations.
-   : The standalone mining software designed to connect to the WEPO blockchain and perform PoW to earn block rewards. It reflects the dynamic reward schedule.
-   : A daemon intended to serve as the bridge between the frontend wallet UI and the core WEPO blockchain, though its full integration with the frontend might still be a pending step.
-   : Document outlining the conceptual design and architectural decisions for the WEPO blockchain, including its various components and their interactions.
-   : This file captures the final, agreed-upon tokenomics model with the refined Year 1 mining reward schedule (Option A: 400, 200, 100, 50 WEPO per block quarterly).

<pending_tasks>
- No explicit pending tasks were left by the previous AI engineer. The last confirmed action was the implementation of the revised tokenomics.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Currently, the WEPO cryptocurrency project has a functional frontend wallet and a foundational blockchain backend.

**Frontend Wallet ():**
- **User Interface:** A comprehensive React-based wallet interface is implemented, including components for:
    - Wallet creation () with secure BIP39 12-word seed phrase generation (using  for cryptographic randomness).
    - User login () with username/password.
    - A dashboard () displaying a zero-initial balance and a mock transaction history (now removed, showing real activity when connected).
    - Features like sending () and receiving () WEPO.
    - A built-in BTC-to-WEPO DEX () for atomic swaps, currently a UI representation.
    - Interfaces for Staking () and Masternode () participation, which are visually locked and display an 18-month countdown until activation.
    - A settings panel ().
- **State Management:**  handles global wallet state, ensuring secure storage and retrieval of wallet data (local storage for demo purposes, but aiming for actual blockchain connection).
- **Fixes:** Initial issues with wallet generation (insecure seed, demo balance) have been resolved.

**Backend Blockchain ():**
- **Core Blockchain:** A Python-based blockchain () is implemented, capable of:
    - Generating blocks with a proof-of-work mechanism.
    - Handling transactions.
    - Incorporating the **finalized Option A tokenomics** with the aggressive Year 1 mining reward schedule (Q1: 400 WEPO/block, Q2: 200 WEPO/block, Q3: 100 WEPO/block, Q4: 50 WEPO/block).
    - Correctly handling JSON serialization of data.
- **Mining Software:** A basic miner () exists to interact with the blockchain.
- **Architectural Blueprint:**  outlines the design.
- **Deployment Scripts:** Basic , ,  are present.

**Current Nuances:**
- The frontend wallet is designed to connect to a real blockchain for balance and transactions, but the full, robust integration with the newly built  (especially the  daemon) might require further development and explicit connection logic.
- The 18-month lock on PoS/Masternodes is currently a frontend UI display, not enforced by a live blockchain mechanism.
- The BTC-to-WEPO DEX is a UI representation; the underlying atomic swap mechanism is conceptualized but not fully implemented within the existing codebase.
