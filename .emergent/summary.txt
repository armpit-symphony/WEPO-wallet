The AI engineer's work on the WEPO application progressed through several key phases: initial MVP hardening, cross-platform wallet development (Electron, iOS, Android), and the implementation of a comprehensive Halving-Cycle Governance System. A significant recent focus was on a community-driven DEX for BTC/WEPO exchange and associated dynamic collateral. The engineer initially over-engineered the dynamic collateral with USD targets and bootstrap incentives, leading to a tokenomics violation. This was meticulously reverted to align with the original fixed WEPO collateral and community-determined pricing. The most recent work involved fixing a recurring wallet authentication issue and then systematically reverting the over-engineered DEX features. Currently, the system is mostly restored to its original design, with immediate attention required for implementing a missing PoS collateral API endpoint.

<product_requirements>
The WEPO project is a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency. Its core features include a secure 16-word BIP-39 wallet, Dilithium2 quantum resistance, feeless E2E encrypted messaging, and a unified wallet supporting WEPO and Bitcoin. The tokenomics specify a fixed supply of 69,000,003 WEPO with no-burn fee redistribution (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers), aiming for a community-mined genesis block on Christmas Day 2025. Masternodes are intended to provide transaction mixing for private Bitcoin on-ramping.

Prior development addressed security, Bitcoin mainnet integration, Quantum Vault fixes, and wallet authentication. Recent explicit requests included developing a downloadable Windows desktop wallet, an iOS mobile application (SwiftUI for TestFlight), and an Android mobile application (Jetpack Compose for Google Play) for platform uniformity.

The current focus is on a democratic, decentralized masternode governance system with community veto, time-locked voting, and governance windows tied to the PoW halving schedule, ensuring immutable core principles. Additionally, the user explicitly desired a fair market price DEX for BTC/WEPO on/off-ramping, driven entirely by the community without central bank or government influence, and using the DEX's internal price for dynamic collateral, not external oracles.

<code_architecture>
The application features a full-stack setup with React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and a custom Python blockchain.



- : This is the primary backend API server using FastAPI. It has undergone extensive modifications. Initially, it was enhanced with security features, new Bitcoin endpoints (fixed to BIP44 derivation), and governance endpoints (for halving-cycle governance and protection mechanisms). More recently, it was significantly refactored to first implement a community-driven dynamic collateral and bootstrap incentive system, and then completely reverted to remove these additions and integrate the  for a simpler, original design. It now includes endpoints for swap rates, liquidity management, and masternode requirements, stripped of the previously added USD-targeting logic and bootstrap bonuses.
- : Defines core blockchain parameters, including the PoW halving schedule and the original dynamic collateral schedule for Masternodes and PoS staking. This file was extensively referenced to confirm the halving schedule and the intended collateral behavior, and its definitions are now expected to be used by the backend.
- : A newly created Python file intended to encapsulate the logic for the enhanced halving-cycle governance system. This module defines classes and methods for managing governance windows, proposal submissions, and protection mechanisms.
- : A new React component created to serve as the user interface for the WEPO Halving-Cycle Governance System. It displays governance status, halving schedules, active proposals, and allows for proposal creation.
- : The main React application file. It was modified to integrate the new  component into the primary navigation flow, allowing users to access the governance features from the main application.
- : This component was modified to include a navigation button for the new , making it accessible from the main user dashboard.
- : A new Markdown file created to provide comprehensive documentation for users on how the WEPO governance system works, including its principles, mechanisms, and schedule.
- : This React component handles the initial wallet creation process. It was extensively modified to fix critical bugs related to form field selectors, seed phrase backup checkboxes, and to ensure proper integration with  for consistent session management.
- : This component handles user login. It was examined to understand the overall authentication flow alongside .
- : This React context manages the global wallet state and functions. A critical fix was implemented here by properly exporting the  function, resolving a major blocker in the wallet authentication flow.
- : A newly created Python file that encapsulates the logic for the clean, original community-driven fair market DEX. It defines the  class which handles liquidity, swaps, and market statistics based on the community-driven price. This file replaced the previously over-engineered dynamic collateral and bootstrap incentive systems.
- : This React component provides the UI for the decentralized exchange. It was initially modified to display the over-engineered dynamic collateral and bootstrap incentives, but these additions were subsequently removed during the system's reversion to align with the original design. It now focuses solely on displaying community-driven market data.
- : This Markdown file contains the development TODO list. It was updated to reflect the completion of the governance system and the community-driven dynamic collateral (after its reversion to the original design).
- : This file is frequently updated with testing results for both backend and frontend components. It serves as a crucial record of progress, identified bugs, and their resolution status throughout the development cycle.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the primary focus was on addressing and reverting the previously implemented (and unrequested) dynamic collateral and bootstrap incentive systems to align with the original WEPO vision.

The AI engineer had:
1.  **Implemented Halving-Cycle Governance System**: This system, defined in  and integrated via  endpoints, ensures governance windows activate around PoW halving events. Protection mechanisms like 1-masternode-1-vote, 30% community veto, and time-locked implementations were added. A frontend  component was created and integrated into  and .
2.  **Fixed Wallet Authentication**: A critical bug in the frontend wallet creation flow, specifically in  and  (missing  export), was identified and resolved, enabling full frontend testing.
3.  **Reverted Dynamic Collateral and Bootstrap Incentives**: Upon user clarification, the AI engineer initiated a full rollback of the previously introduced USD-targeted dynamic collateral and bootstrap incentive systems. This involved:
    *   Creating a new clean implementation file: .
    *   Extensively modifying  to remove all traces of the over-engineered classes, functions, and API endpoints related to dynamic collateral (USD-targeted) and bootstrap incentives (e.g., , ).
    *   Updating  to remove the UI elements that displayed these now-removed features, ensuring the frontend reflects the original community-driven DEX philosophy.
    *   Performing multiple rounds of testing and further cleanup after each attempt, including full service restarts, to ensure no contamination from the old code remained in the backend responses.

The most recent activity (Chat Message 309 onwards) involved verifying the state of the system post-reversion. Testing confirmed that the Community Fair Market is clean and functional, and the Masternode Collateral System is working with its original fixed WEPO requirements as defined in . However, two issues were identified:
1.  **PoS (Proof of Stake) Collateral**: The system  defines PoS collateral, but there are no accessible API endpoints to retrieve this information.
2.  **Liquidity Addition HTTP 500 Error**: An error related to  in  was initially found but later resolved during cleanup.

The current state is that the core governance and community fair market DEX are implemented as per the original vision, but the PoS collateral requirements are not yet exposed via an API.
