The AI engineer successfully transitioned the WEPO application from an MVP to a robust, production-ready system. The initial phase focused on a comprehensive security audit, fixing critical backend vulnerabilities and implementing robust frontend security, achieving a 100% security score. Subsequently, the engineer refined the wallet's UI by changing Regular/Quantum to Public/Private and repositioning elements. A major milestone was the full Bitcoin mainnet integration, which required activating , integrating the BlockCypher API, and implementing crucial backend endpoints for balance, network status, address generation, wallet initialization, UTXO management, and transaction broadcasting. This involved extensive debugging of endpoint routing, class structure, and prop mismatches. A critical fix involved correcting the Bitcoin wallet's derivation path from mock addresses to standard BIP44 for true self-custody. The Quantum Vault functionality was also fully restored by fixing frontend rendering issues related to missing data properties. Finally, the engineer packaged a complete Electron-based desktop wallet for Windows and prepared comprehensive documentation for simplified network deployment and iOS app handoff, concluding the development phase.

<product_requirements>
The WEPO project aims to create a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency ensuring financial freedom. Key features include a secure 16-word BIP-39 wallet, Dilithium2 quantum resistance, feeless E2E encrypted messaging, and a unified wallet for both WEPO and Bitcoin. The tokenomics specify a fixed supply of 69,000,003 WEPO with no-burn fee redistribution (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers), targeting a community-mined genesis block on Christmas Day 2025. Masternodes offer five services, including Transaction Mixing for privacy-focused Bitcoin on-ramping. Previous foundational work included a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet and Masternode BTC Mixing. Recent development cycles prioritized achieving a production-ready security posture, fully integrating and activating Bitcoin mainnet functionality, clarifying masternode-based privacy, and resolving issues like RWA Quantum Vault, mining rewards, wallet authentication, and seed phrase randomization.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has most recently focused on preparing the WEPO application for broad distribution and deployment. This involved two major efforts following the successful 100% integration and audit of Bitcoin functionality and resolution of the Quantum Vault bug.

Firstly, a **downloadable Windows desktop wallet** was created using Electron. This involved setting up a new directory , creating a  for Electron dependencies, and developing core Electron components (, ). Crucially, a lightweight **Node.js backend replica ()** was built to handle API calls locally for the desktop app, ensuring the self-custodial nature by eliminating reliance on a remote backend. The existing React frontend code was adapted for this desktop environment. Release scripts (, , ) were created to package the application into a  file (168MB), making it ready for GitHub distribution with a simple one-click Windows launcher.

Secondly, the engineer prepared for **WEPO network deployment**. After initially troubleshooting local blockchain  issues, it was clarified that  *is* the comprehensive backend blockchain, ready for deployment. A full deployment package () was created, including  (for server setup),  (for local execution to upload and configure), , and . This package automates server setup, file upload, Nginx/SSL configuration, service startup, and endpoint testing, enabling a live WEPO network in approximately 30 minutes.

Lastly, in preparation for a project handoff, the AI engineer created a **** to guide the next engineer in developing an iOS application for TestFlight and a **** to provide a comprehensive summary of the project's completed work.
