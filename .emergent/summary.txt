The previous AI engineer's work on the WEPO application progressed through initial MVP hardening, cross-platform wallet development, and implementing a Halving-Cycle Governance System. A significant task involved reverting an over-engineered DEX for BTC/WEPO, restoring it to a simpler, community-driven design. Wallet authentication issues were addressed.

Subsequently, the engineer investigated a reported missing PoS collateral API endpoint, discovering the backend endpoints were functional but required frontend integration, which was successfully completed. Further backend issues related to mining, staking, and database storage were identified and resolved, achieving 100% backend functionality. Wallet authentication, a user concern, was confirmed to be working perfectly.

The final, critical phase focused on API security. Despite multiple attempts to implement brute force protection and global rate limiting (including a  integration), critical vulnerabilities persist. The system currently has a 44.2% security score, blocking the Christmas Day 2025 launch. The last action was updating handover documentation to guide the next engineer in resolving these unresolved security integration issues.

<product_requirements>
The WEPO project is a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency featuring a secure 16-word BIP-39 wallet, Dilithium2 quantum resistance, feeless E2E encrypted messaging, and a unified wallet supporting WEPO, Bitcoin, and RWA tokens. Its tokenomics define a fixed supply of 69,000,003 WEPO with no-burn fee redistribution (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers), aiming for a community-mined genesis block on Christmas Day 2025. Masternodes are designed for private Bitcoin transaction mixing.

Prior development addressed security, Bitcoin mainnet integration, Quantum Vault fixes, and wallet authentication. Recent explicit requests included developing downloadable Windows desktop, iOS (SwiftUI), and Android (Jetpack Compose) mobile wallets for platform uniformity. A democratic, decentralized masternode governance system with community veto, time-locked voting, and halving-cycle tied governance windows was also a key requirement. Furthermore, a fair market price DEX for BTC/WEPO on/off-ramping, driven entirely by the community (without external oracles) and using its internal price for dynamic collateral, was desired.

The application features a full-stack setup with React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and a custom Python blockchain.



-   : This is the primary backend API server using FastAPI.
    -   **Summary of importance:** Manages all API routes, blockchain interactions, and integrates with security features. It was central to implementing and reverting DEX features, fixing PoS collateral, and handling mining/staking/network endpoints.
    -   **Changes made:** Reverted over-engineered DEX features; implemented endpoints for swap rates, liquidity, and masternode requirements; added missing  and  endpoints; removed duplicate  endpoints; corrected mining status field names. Multiple attempts were made to implement brute force protection (account lockout) and global/endpoint-specific rate limiting (including  and  integration). These security fixes are currently failing. Duplicate imports were cleaned up.
-   : Contains backend security utilities.
    -   **Summary of importance:** Implements rate limiting, brute force tracking, and input validation.
    -   **Changes made:** Modified to include  rate limit configuration and updated with brute force protection logic, though integration issues persist. It attempts to use Redis for rate limiting, but a fallback to in-memory storage had bugs.
-   : Defines core blockchain parameters and collateral schedules.
    -   **Summary of importance:** Source of truth for PoW halving schedule and PoS staking/Masternode collateral requirements.
    -   **Changes made:** Extensively referenced for collateral behavior and halving schedule. No direct modifications mentioned.
-   : The main user dashboard component.
    -   **Summary of importance:** Displays key user information, including PoS and Masternode status.
    -   **Changes made:** Modified to fetch and display actual PoS collateral requirements and masternode dynamic collateral information from the backend, enhancing the UI to reflect live data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the primary focus was on addressing critical security vulnerabilities in the WEPO application, specifically regarding brute force protection and API rate limiting. Despite multiple comprehensive security audits consistently showing low security scores (currently 44.2%), these issues remain unresolved.

The previous AI engineer's recent efforts included:
1.  **Brute Force Protection**: Multiple attempts were made to implement account lockout after failed login attempts, modifying the login endpoint in  and attempting to integrate with  in . Different direct implementations and integrations were tried, but the feature remained non-functional, consistently failing to lock out accounts after repeated login failures.
2.  **Rate Limiting**: Global and endpoint-specific API rate limiting was attempted by adding middleware in  and configuring the . This included researching and attempting to integrate the  library with  for a more robust solution, installing  as a dependency. However, the rate limiting mechanisms failed to activate or perform as expected, allowing an unlimited number of requests.
3.  **Dedicated Security Fix File**: A new file, , was created to centralize and apply the latest security solution, which was then integrated into .

Despite these extensive efforts, security testing revealed that the core issues persist, indicating a fundamental integration problem between the security logic and the FastAPI application's request handling. The system's security score remains critically low (44.2%), blocking the planned Christmas Day 2025 launch. The last actions involved updating key handover documentation in the  folder to clearly communicate the unresolved security challenges and guide the next engineer.
