<analysis>
The AI engineer systematically enhanced the WEPO application, addressing critical security and core feature requirements. Initially, the focus was on establishing true E2E messaging and implementing a robust hybrid PoW/PoS consensus with dynamic collateral. A significant wallet authentication bug was resolved, and simulated quantum resistance was upgraded to a real Dilithium2 implementation. Subsequently, the focus shifted to enhancing privacy and functionality based on user feedback. The engineer successfully integrated production-grade zk-STARKs for the Quantum Vault, improved staking info endpoints, and developed a foundational governance framework. Most recently, a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet was implemented, and a Masternode BTC Mixing Service was added, laying the groundwork for a privacy-focused on-ramp. Challenges included dependency conflicts and debugging import errors, which were resolved methodically.

<product_requirements>
The WEPO project aims to be a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency offering financial freedom. Key features include a secure 16-word seed phrase wallet, real Dilithium2 quantum resistance, and a feeless, true End-to-End Encrypted (E2E) messaging system. It supports Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization and a unified wallet for WEPO and BTC. Tokenomics involve a no-burn fee redistribution (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers) from a fixed supply of 69,000,003 WEPO. A community-mined genesis block is planned. The hybrid PoW/PoS consensus features 9-minute PoW blocks and 3-minute PoS blocks (activating at block 131,400). Masternodes must provide 5 genuine services (Transaction Mixing, DEX Relay, Network Relay, Governance, Vault Relay) with specific runtimes, earning dynamic collateral adjusted with PoW halvings. The Unified Exchange is intended as a simple BTC/WEPO/RWA swap system, with community-driven pricing and masternode-powered privacy mixing for on-ramping.
