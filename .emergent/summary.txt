The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the WEPO application from an MVP to a robust, production-ready system with a primary focus on security. Initially, the engineer resolved critical issues like frontend  polyfill errors, integrated RWA trading, and implemented wallet-integrated PoW mining. The core of the trajectory, however, details a comprehensive security audit and remediation effort. This involved fixing critical backend vulnerabilities (e.g., wallet authentication, mining rewards, RWA Quantum Vault endpoints) and then a deep dive into security enhancements. A major discovery was that , not , was serving API requests, necessitating security fixes to be applied there. Frontend security was bolstered with  for validation and a new  (Express with Helmet) to apply HTTP security headers. The engineer systematically addressed multiple rounds of audit feedback, ultimately achieving a 95% security score by resolving all critical vulnerabilities, with only minor validation message refinements remaining.

The WEPO project is a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency aiming for financial freedom. Key features include a secure 16-word BIP-39 seed phrase wallet, Dilithium2 quantum resistance, feeless E2E encrypted messaging, and a unified wallet for WEPO and Bitcoin. The tokenomics specify a 69,000,003 WEPO fixed supply with no-burn fee redistribution (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers). A community-mined genesis block is planned for Christmas Day 2025, offering a special 400 WEPO reward. Masternodes provide five services, including Transaction Mixing for privacy-focused on-ramping. Previous work established a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet and Masternode BTC Mixing. Recent efforts focused on RWA integration, clearing test data, implementing wallet-integrated PoW mining, and resolving critical issues related to RWA Quantum Vaults, mining reward consistency, wallet authentication flow, and seed phrase randomization. The immediate focus shifted to conducting and implementing comprehensive security fixes to achieve a production-ready state.

    -   **Importance**: This is the primary backend API server for the application. It handles core logic, including wallet, RWA, and transaction processing.
    -   **Changes**: Received comprehensive security enhancements including the integration of , robust transaction validation (amount, address, XSS), and the implementation of all critical HTTP security headers. Wallet creation and login endpoints were also fortified with rate limiting and enhanced validation.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: A newly created Python utility module to centralize backend security functions like rate limiting (Redis/in-memory), password hashing, and XSS sanitization.
    -   **Changes**: New file created. Contains the core logic for backend security checks, designed to be imported and used by FastAPI endpoints in .
-   :
    -   **Importance**: A newly created JavaScript utility for comprehensive client-side input validation and sanitization.
    -   **Changes**: New file created. Implements functions for validating transaction amounts (positive, non-zero, decimal precision, scientific notation), address formats, and detecting malicious content (XSS). This is critical for immediate user feedback and preliminary security.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: A newly created Express.js server responsible for serving the React frontend in a production-like environment. It was crucial for applying HTTP security headers to the frontend static assets and initial page load.
    -   **Changes**: New file created. Configured with  middleware to enforce critical HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options) that the default Create React App development server does not provide.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed a comprehensive security audit and implemented extensive fixes, bringing the WEPO application to a 95% security score. The primary focus was on addressing critical vulnerabilities that could risk user funds.

Key achievements include:
*   **Backend Security ()**: Implemented a  for rate limiting, password hashing, and XSS sanitization. Significantly enhanced transaction validation to reject negative/zero/excessive amounts, invalid addresses, scientific notation, and XSS payloads. All 5 critical HTTP security headers (Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection) were successfully applied to API endpoints.
*   **Frontend Security**: Integrated client-side transaction and input validation using  in components like  and . Crucially, a new  (Express server with  middleware) was deployed to serve the React frontend, ensuring all HTTP security headers are now correctly applied to the frontend as well. This addressed a major gap where the frontend was previously served without these headers.
*   **Secure Session Management**: Enhanced practices in  for better session handling and reduced sensitive data exposure through logging.

The system's security score dramatically increased from 25% to 95%. All critical vulnerabilities such as transaction manipulation, XSS attacks, missing security headers, and sensitive data exposure have been resolved. The application is now considered production-ready from a security standpoint, with the remaining 5% pertaining to minor refinements in validation error messages for improved user experience.
