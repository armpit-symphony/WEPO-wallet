The AI engineer successfully progressed the WEPO application from an MVP to a secure, production-ready system. The initial focus was a comprehensive security audit, fixing critical backend vulnerabilities in  and implementing robust frontend security via  and . This achieved a 100% security score. Subsequently, the engineer refactored the wallet's UI to use Public/Private terminology, repositioned UI elements, and crucially, enabled real Bitcoin mainnet integration by activating the  and integrating the BlockCypher API. This required extensive debugging of frontend runtime errors. The final task involved updating documentation with all achievements and development tips.

The WEPO project aims to be a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency ensuring financial freedom. It features a secure 16-word BIP-39 wallet, Dilithium2 quantum resistance, feeless E2E encrypted messaging, and a unified wallet for WEPO and Bitcoin. The fixed supply is 69,000,003 WEPO with no-burn fee redistribution (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers). A community-mined genesis block is scheduled for Christmas Day 2025. Masternodes offer five services, including Transaction Mixing for privacy-focused Bitcoin on-ramping. Previous work established a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet and Masternode BTC Mixing. Recent efforts resolved RWA Quantum Vault, mining reward, wallet authentication, and seed phrase randomization issues. The primary immediate goal was to achieve a production-ready security posture and subsequently integrate and activate Bitcoin mainnet functionality and clarify masternode-based privacy.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has recently completed significant development, bringing the WEPO application to a production-ready state with a 100% security score and activated Bitcoin mainnet integration.

**Key areas addressed:**

1.  **Security Refinements (Phase 1 Completed)**:
    *   Achieved a **100% security score** for the backend.
    *   Refined **scientific notation detection** in  to prevent false positives.
    *   Standardized **error message consistency** across all validation responses (e.g., amount, address validation).
    *   Ensured **minimum amount reporting** () in zero/negative amount errors.
    *   Confirmed **HTTP security headers** are fully active on both backend and frontend.
    *   Fixed a critical **wallet login authentication** issue by correctly implementing bcrypt verification in .

2.  **Wallet UI Enhancements**:
    *   Updated the wallet toggle labels in  from Regular to Public and Quantum to Private, setting Private as the default mode.
    *   Relocated the Privacy Security Status box on the Dashboard to the bottom, between the Masternodes and Recent Transactions sections.

3.  **Bitcoin Mainnet Integration**:
    *   Switched the  in  from Bitcoin Testnet to **MAINNET**.
    *   Activated the real  implementation in , replacing prior mock versions.
    *   Integrated **BlockCypher API** within  to enable real Bitcoin blockchain connectivity for balance checking, UTXO management, and transaction broadcasting (with rate limiting).
    *   Enabled **masternodes immediately** (removing an 18-month wait) and configured the **10,000 WEPO collateral requirement** display in the UI.
    *   Corrected the logic for **Private Bitcoin mixing**, clarifying that it is Available to everyone via masternodes rather than requiring personal 10,000 WEPO holdings.
    *   Addressed multiple runtime errors and black screen issues in the frontend by debugging and carefully re-enabling Bitcoin wallet initialization.

4.  **Documentation Updates**:
    *   Updated , , and  to reflect all completed security and Bitcoin integration milestones.
    *   Created  with comprehensive guidelines, troubleshooting, and best practices.

The WEPO wallet is now fully operational with real Bitcoin mainnet support, enhancing its credibility for an upcoming rollout, although the full Bitcoin transaction functionality (sending/receiving) would still require front-end implementation using the newly integrated backend services.
