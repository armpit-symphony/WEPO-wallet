The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the WEPO project, initially a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, into a quantum-resistant, RWA-tokenization capable platform with an intricate tokenomics model. Key achievements include implementing Dilithium for quantum resistance, a no-fee universal quantum messenger, and a comprehensive RWA tokenization system. A major tokenomics overhaul was completed, featuring a dynamic mining reward schedule and a no-burn fee redistribution system (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% Stakers).

Initially, the focus was on resolving frontend integration issues (RWA endpoints) and authentication flow problems. The RWA creation endpoint was fixed, including adding an alias and ensuring correct balance checks. Frontend authentication was also resolved, making RWA features accessible.

Subsequently, the project shifted to long-term readiness. Advanced P2P network testing achieved 100% success. A comprehensive security audit revealed critical import-related issues, which were systematically fixed, boosting the security score from 56.2% to 95.3%. Production staking mechanism activation was largely completed. A significant economic enhancement was implemented: a dynamic masternode collateral reduction schedule (from 10,000 to 500 WEPO over years), ensuring long-term accessibility. Masternode networking and governance features, including proposal and voting systems, were successfully integrated and tested. The current task involves implementing the technical framework for a community-mined genesis block, aligning with WEPO's decentralized ethos.

<product_requirements>
The WEPO project is a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency with hybrid PoW/PoS consensus and Masternodes, built on an anti-establishment ethos emphasizing financial freedom. Core features include 16-word seed recovery, username/password login, BTC-to-WEPO Atomic DEX, and PoS/Masternode options.
Initial implementation covered blockchain core, P2P, staking, privacy (zk-STARKs, Ring Signatures, Confidential Transactions), and HTLC-based Atomic Swaps.
The project expanded to include:
1.  **Quantum Resistance**: Dilithium signatures for transactions and a universal, no-fee quantum messaging system.
2.  **RWA Tokenization**: Ability to create Real World Assets with DEX trading. This evolved to include a WEPO balance requirement and a fee (double normal transaction fee) for RWA creation.
3.  **Tokenomics Overhaul**: A comprehensive no-burn fee redistribution policy (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers) for all network fees. The mining schedule was revised to a 6-month phased reduction over 18 months (400, 200, 100 WEPO/block), then transitioning to PoS/Masternode rewards.

<current_work>
The WEPO project is in an advanced stage, with core backend tokenomics, RWA tokenization, and critical security fixes largely completed.

**Recent Accomplishments:**
1.  **RWA Tokenization & Tokenomics Fixes**: The  module was implemented, and  was updated to correctly handle RWA asset creation fees into the redistribution pool. Frontend  correctly displays fees and enforces balance checks. Authentication issues in  preventing access to the RWA dashboard were resolved. The RWA creation endpoint () and its alias () are now fully functional, correctly validating WEPO balance.
2.  **Security Overhaul**: Advanced P2P network testing completed with 100% success. Critical security audit issues, primarily related to module imports and cryptographic key handling (, ), were identified and fixed. This significantly improved the overall security score from 56.2% to 95.3%.
3.  **Dynamic Masternode Collateral**: A crucial long-term economic feature was implemented, dynamically reducing Masternode collateral requirements from 10,000 WEPO down to 500 WEPO over several years, tied to mining halving events. This was integrated into  and  and validated with dedicated tests.
4.  **Masternode Networking and Governance**: The foundational elements for Masternode networking and governance were implemented, including API endpoints for managing proposals and viewing network statistics.

**Current Focus**:
The immediate work is on implementing the technical framework for the **Community-Mined Genesis Block**. This involves creating the necessary blockchain components and then developing the community mining software, which is the very next step. The goal is to ensure a fair, decentralized, and community-driven launch from block #0.
