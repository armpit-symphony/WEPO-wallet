The previous AI engineer meticulously progressed the WEPO project, initially setting up the architecture and implementing core features like Quantum Vault, RWA tokenization, and a dynamic masternode system. A significant portion of the work involved refining the tokenomics, specifically reconciling the total supply to 69,000,003 WEPO and implementing a complex 20-year PoW mining schedule with specific halving phases. The AI successfully integrated this into  and . Subsequent efforts focused on comprehensive audits of existing features based on user concerns. Key achievements include fixing the wallet creation and session persistence issues, ensuring the Quantum Vault is accessible as an internal wallet feature, and extensively updating the README.md. The latest work identified critical security and implementation gaps in the messaging system (not true E2E), Dilithium2 simulation, PoS consensus (not truly hybrid), and Masternode services (no actual utility). The AI documented these findings in  for the next engineer.

<product_requirements>
The WEPO project is a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency leveraging hybrid PoW/PoS and Masternodes for financial freedom. Key requirements include a core wallet with a 16-word seed and secure login. Quantum resistance is critical, using Dilithium signatures and a feeless messaging system. RWA tokenization involves asset creation with DEX trading, WEPO balance requirements, and file uploads. Tokenomics mandates no-burn fee redistribution (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers), with a confirmed total supply of 69,000,003 WEPO. A community-mined genesis block is planned. A unified wallet supports WEPO and BTC, with a community-driven AMM exchange. The Quantum Vault provides zk-STARK-protected private storage for WEPO and RWA, enabling Ghost Transfers. A revised PoW mining schedule ensures 10% of total supply (6.9M WEPO) is mined in the first 18 months (6-min blocks, constant reward), with PoW continuing for ~20 years alongside PoS/Masternodes at a 9-minute block time and specific 3, 6, 3, 3-year halvings.

**Key Files and Their Importance (with recent changes):**

-   : Central router. **Modified** to correctly render  instead of  based on  for proper wallet flow and persistence.
-   : Central UI. Imports . Displays Quantum Vault button.
-   : Handles user login. **Modified** to include  on successful login.
-   : Handles new wallet creation and seed phrase. **Modified** to set  items (, ) after wallet creation to ensure persistence and correct navigation.
-   : Core blockchain logic. **Heavily modified** to implement the new 20-year PoW mining schedule (constants for block rewards and block times for different phases) and production staking activation. Conflicting  information was largely resolved. Still shows  (line 913), indicating PoS consensus is not yet implemented despite activation.
-   : Core backend logic for Quantum Vault. **Extensively modified** to implement Ghost Transfer capabilities using custom zk-STARK-style proofs, nullifiers, and commitment schemes. Supports multi-asset (WEPO and RWA) storage and transfers.
-   : FastAPI backend. **Crucially updated** to include Quantum Vault, Ghost Transfer, and RWA-specific endpoints. **Most recently updated** to reflect new tokenomics, including the 20-year PoW schedule and staking endpoints, and to fix total supply inconsistencies.
-   : Project documentation. **Extensively updated** to reflect the new 20-year tokenomics and the **single unified wallet architecture**, removing outdated multi-wallet terminology. Now includes a prominent section directing to security audit reports.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on a comprehensive audit of the WEPO project's security and implementation claims, based on user feedback. This followed successful implementation and testing of the new 20-year PoW mining schedule and fixing critical wallet creation and session persistence issues.

The primary activity was conducting a detailed audit of the following systems:
1.  **Messaging System**: Investigated claims of end-to-end encryption. Found a critical flaw: the symmetric encryption key is stored in plaintext on the server, and the server can decrypt all messages, meaning it's not truly E2E private. This was identified in  and .
2.  **Dilithium2 Signatures**: Audited the usage of Dilithium2. Found that  uses an RSA backend with Dilithium formatting, meaning it's simulated, not truly quantum-resistant.
3.  **PoS Consensus**: Examined the PoS block timing and consensus. Discovered that despite PoS rewards being distributed, the system still uses PoW consensus ( line 913: ), meaning no actual PoS blocks are being produced and it's not a true hybrid consensus.
4.  **Masternode Network**: Audited masternode functionality. Found that while the framework for masternodes exists, they provide no actual network services (like privacy mixing, DEX relay, or governance execution) despite earning 60% of transaction fees. This was based on analysis of , , , and .

All these findings, along with recommendations and code references, were documented in two new files:  (detailed) and  (summary). A prominent notice was also added to  directing future engineers to these audit reports. The last action was adding the Masternode audit findings to the security audit report and summary.
