The previous AI engineer successfully brought the WEPO project from conception to a near-complete state. Initially, they integrated quantum resistance and RWA tokenization, establishing a complex tokenomics model. Key early tasks included fixing frontend issues, enhancing P2P networking, boosting security, and implementing a dynamic masternode system. The focus then shifted to the Community-Mined Genesis Block, culminating in the Community Mining Software.

The user then pivoted, requesting BTC functionality into a unified wallet, leading to significant refactoring by removing redundant wallet types and atomic swap logic. The primary challenge became unifying WEPO-BTC and WEPO-RWA exchange functions. The AI engineer debugged and refactored the frontend (, ) and backend (, ) extensively. They discovered conflicting backend processes and adapted the  to correctly host the new Community-Driven AMM endpoints. Upon user feedback, hardcoded exchange rates and incorrect fee handling were rectified by implementing a zero-admin AMM system where market pricing is user-determined, and fees are redistributed. Comprehensive backend and frontend testing confirmed the AMM's functionality. The final task in this trajectory involved initiating the Quantum Vault implementation, including backend APIs and frontend integration, which is currently underway.

<product_requirements>
The WEPO project aims to be a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency (We The People) with hybrid PoW/PoS consensus and Masternodes, emphasizing financial freedom and a fair launch. Key requirements included:
1.  **Core Wallet**: 16-word seed, username/password login, PoS/Masternode options (locked until activation), feeless quantum-resistant private messaging.
2.  **Quantum Resistance**: Dilithium signatures and a no-fee universal quantum messaging system.
3.  **RWA Tokenization**: Ability to create Real World Assets with DEX trading, including a WEPO balance requirement and creation fee, with document/image uploads.
4.  **Tokenomics**: No-burn fee redistribution (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers), 18 months pure PoW mining (3 halvings), then PoS/Masternodes activate.
5.  **Community-Mined Genesis Block**: Technical framework and mining software for a decentralized launch (Christmas 2025, 3:00 PM NY time).
6.  **Unified Wallet**: Consolidate multiple wallet types into a single WEPO wallet capable of managing both WEPO and Bitcoin, eliminating complex atomic swaps in favor of internal exchanges.
7.  **Unified Exchange Interface**: Consolidate all trading functionalities (BTC-WEPO and RWA-WEPO) into a single, comprehensive exchange page with market-determined pricing (no hardcoded rates) and 100% fee redistribution.
8.  **Quantum Vault**: Transform Quantum Wallet into a Quantum Vault for private, zk-STARK-protected WEPO storage, with Auto-Deposit for all incoming funds.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing the **Quantum Vault** feature, which is designed as the be your own bank and ultimate privacy solution for WEPO. This involves integrating zk-STARK protected private storage with an auto-deposit functionality for all incoming WEPO.

The work completed on the Quantum Vault includes:
1.  **Backend Implementation**:
    *   Created a new file: , which will house the core logic for the Quantum Vault.
    *   Added new FastAPI endpoints to  for Quantum Vault operations. These endpoints include:
        *   : To initialize a user's Quantum Vault.
        *   : To manually deposit WEPO into the vault.
        *   : To withdraw WEPO from the vault back to the regular wallet.
        *   : To check the current status and balance of the vault.
        *   : To enable or disable automatic deposits of all incoming WEPO into the vault.
    *   Successfully tested these backend endpoints, confirming their functionality for creation, status, deposit, and auto-deposit.

2.  **Frontend Integration**:
    *   Created a new React component: , which will provide the user interface for the vault.
    *   Integrated this  component into the main . This involved:
        *   Importing the  component.
        *   Adding a new state variable () to control the visibility of the vault interface.
        *   Adjusting the Dashboard's quick action buttons layout from a 3-column to a 4-column grid to accommodate a new Quantum Vault button.
        *   Adding the Quantum Vault button to the Dashboard.
        *   Rendering the  component conditionally within the .
        *   Resolved several linting and reference errors in  related to outdated , , and missing  function and icon imports (ToggleLeft, ToggleRight) during the integration process.

The frontend has successfully compiled after these changes. The last action was taking a screenshot which showed the wallet creation screen, implying the Quantum Vault feature is visually integrated, though navigating to it requires wallet setup. The AI engineer was about to clear the test market values, similar to how it was done for the AMM pools, likely in preparation for further testing or a clean state for the new feature.

<optional_next_step>
Reset test market values to zero in the backend to ensure a clean state for Quantum Vault testing or subsequent user interactions.
