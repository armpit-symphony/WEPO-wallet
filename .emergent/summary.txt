The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the WEPO project from initial concept to a feature-rich application. Key developments included integrating quantum resistance, RWA tokenization, and a dynamic masternode system, culminating in the Community Mining Software. The focus then shifted to unifying the wallet for WEPO and BTC, extensively refactoring the exchange interface for a community-driven AMM with zero-admin principles.

The current trajectory details several major feature implementations: the completion and extensive testing of the Quantum Vault for private WEPO storage; the groundbreaking Ghost Transfers for completely private, untraceable vault-to-vault WEPO transactions; and the revolutionary RWA Quantum Vault integration, enabling private storage and transfers of Real-World Assets. Subsequently, the engineer successfully activated and tested the Production Staking mechanism. The immediate past efforts have been focused on a critical re-evaluation and re-design of the entire tokenomics, specifically the PoW mining schedule and total supply, due to inconsistencies and new user requirements. The current task is to align the system with a total supply of 69,000,003 WEPO and a revised, long-term sustainable PoW mining schedule.

<product_requirements>
The WEPO project is a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency with a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus and Masternodes, aiming for financial freedom and a fair launch.
1.  **Core Wallet**: 16-word seed, username/password login, PoS/Masternode options, feeless quantum-resistant private messaging.
2.  **Quantum Resistance**: Dilithium signatures and a no-fee universal quantum messaging system.
3.  **RWA Tokenization**: Creation of Real World Assets with DEX trading, WEPO balance requirement, creation fee, and document/image uploads.
4.  **Tokenomics**: No-burn fee redistribution (60% Masternodes, 25% Miners, 15% PoS Stakers), with an initial 18-month PoW period and subsequent PoS/Masternode activation. The total supply is now set at **69,000,003 WEPO**.
5.  **Community-Mined Genesis Block**: Technical framework and mining software for a decentralized launch (Christmas 2025).
6.  **Unified Wallet & Exchange**: Single wallet for WEPO and BTC, with a unified exchange interface for BTC-WEPO and RWA-WEPO trading, featuring market-determined pricing and 100% fee redistribution.
7.  **Quantum Vault**: Private, zk-STARK-protected WEPO storage with Auto-Deposit functionality for all incoming funds. This has been **extended to support RWA tokens**, allowing private storage and Ghost Transfers (untraceable vault-to-vault transactions) for both WEPO and RWA assets.
8.  **Revised PoW Mining Schedule**: The first 18 months of PoW mining should yield approximately 6.9 million WEPO (10% of total supply), with a 6-minute block time. After 18 months, PoW mining continues indefinitely alongside PoS/Masternodes at a 9-minute block time, with further halvings at 3, 6, 3, and 3-year intervals.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep in a critical re-evaluation and re-design of the WEPO project's core tokenomics and mining schedule. This was triggered by the user identifying inconsistencies in the stated total supply across different documentation and the implemented PoW schedule.

Specifically, the work involved:
1.  **PoW Mining Schedule Re-design**: The previous PoW schedule had inconsistencies (e.g., Phase 3 duration) and mined too much WEPO too quickly. The user requested a new schedule:
    *   **First 18 Months**: Mine approximately 6.9 million WEPO (10% of total supply).
    *   **Block Time**: Consistent 6 minutes per block for the initial 18 months, with 3 halving phases (6 months each).
    *   **Long-term PoW**: Continue mining after 18 months alongside PoS/Masternodes at a 9-minute block time, with further halvings at 3, 6, 3, and 3-year intervals.
    The AI engineer has successfully implemented this new schedule in  (updating , , removing old constants) and  (updating the fast test bridge to match).
2.  **Total Supply Reconciliation**: There was conflicting information about the total supply (e.g., 21M, 63.9M, 63,900,006). The user explicitly clarified the definitive total supply to be **69,000,003 WEPO**, emphasizing the 3,6,9 numerology.
3.  **Tokenomics Audit**: The AI engineer is currently auditing the existing PoS and Masternode reward mechanisms in  to ensure they align with the user's explicit requirement that Masternodes *only* receive rewards from transaction fees.

The immediate task involves auditing the current PoS and Masternode reward implementation to align with the new total supply and fee distribution rules, and then to plan options to fully integrate these changes into the codebase.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Based on the user's explicit request, the next step is to continue auditing the PoS and Masternode reward systems to confirm their adherence to the masternodes only get rewards from transaction fees rule.
