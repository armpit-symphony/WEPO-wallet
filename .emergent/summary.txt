The AI engineer successfully progressed the WEPO project from its MVP state, focusing on critical security and feature enhancements. Initial efforts involved rectifying a false E2E encryption claim in the messaging system by modifying  and  to ensure true client-side decryption. This was followed by implementing a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus in , introducing dynamic block times and stake-weighted validator selection. The Masternode system was then revolutionized by introducing 5 genuine services, updating  and .

A critical wallet authentication bug was identified and fixed in , , and , restoring dashboard access. Subsequently, a dynamic collateral system for Masternodes and PoS was implemented in  and integrated into the , linking adjustments to PoW halving events. The most recent significant work involved upgrading the simulated Dilithium2 quantum resistance to a real implementation using , creating , and updating  and . The frontend () was also updated to display the live quantum security status. Documentation in  and the new  folder was continuously updated throughout these phases, including new engineering tips. The trajectory ended with the user deciding against Confidential Transactions and Ring Signatures, requesting exploration of other privacy features.

<product_requirements>
The WEPO project is a privacy-focused, decentralized cryptocurrency aiming for financial freedom. Key features include a secure wallet with a 16-word seed phrase, quantum resistance (now implemented with real Dilithium2), and a feeless, truly End-to-End Encrypted (E2E) messaging system. It supports Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, including asset creation and DEX trading. The tokenomics feature a no-burn fee redistribution (60% to Masternodes, 25% to Miners, 15% to PoS Stakers) from a fixed total supply of 69,000,003 WEPO. A community-mined genesis block is planned. The application offers a unified wallet for WEPO and BTC, an AMM exchange, and a Quantum Vault with zk-STARK-protected storage and Ghost Transfers. The hybrid PoW/PoS consensus involves a 9-minute PoW block time (post-activation) and 3-minute PoS blocks activating at block 131,400. Masternodes must provide 5 genuine services (Transaction Mixing, DEX Relay, Network Relay, Governance, Vault Relay) with specific runtime requirements (9h for computers, 6h for mobile), earning a dynamic collateral adjusted with PoW halvings.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented and integrated **Real Dilithium2 Quantum-Resistant Signatures** into the WEPO blockchain. This involved:
1.  Researching and identifying the  library as a suitable implementation.
2.  Creating a new file, , to house the actual Dilithium2 key generation, signing, and verification logic.
3.  Modifying  to replace its simulated functionality with the real  implementation, ensuring backward compatibility.
4.  Adding  to both  and .
5.  Updating the backend () with a new  endpoint to expose the quantum readiness status.
6.  Critically, integrating this status into the frontend by modifying  to fetch and display the Quantum Security Status (algorithm, signature size, hash function, quantum readiness) to users, moving beyond a hardcoded  status.

Comprehensive backend testing () confirmed that all core systems, including the new Dilithium2 integration, were operational. Frontend testing () further verified that the quantum resistance status was correctly displayed on the user dashboard.

Following this, the engineer updated extensive documentation:
*    was updated to reflect the quantum resistance achievement and dynamic collateral system.
*   New documents were created in :  (detailing the implementation), and further updates to  and .

The very last exchange involved the user explicitly dismissing the need for Confidential Transactions and Advanced Ring Signatures, stating they would over-complicate the network given existing privacy features like Masternode Transaction Mixing and Ghost Transfers. The user's final instruction was to explore what other privacy items are needed.
