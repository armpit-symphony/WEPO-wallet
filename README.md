## 🔧 FOR DEVELOPERS & AI BUILDERS

### **Code Architecture Notes**
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Always use environment variables for URLs
// Frontend API calls MUST use REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
const backendUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL;

// Backend MUST use MONGO_URL from environment
const mongoUrl = process.env.MONGO_URL;

// All backend routes MUST be prefixed with '/api' for Kubernetes ingress
app.get('/api/mining/status', handler);
```

### **Mining System Integration**
```python
# Wallet Mining Backend Pattern
class WalletMiner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connected_miners = {}  # address -> miner info
        self.mining_stats = {...}   # network statistics
    
    async def connect_miner(address, mode="genesis"):
        # Same pathways as external miners
        # Real-time miner tracking
        # Network statistics updates
```

### **WebWorker Mining Pattern**
```javascript
// mining-worker.js - Browser mining implementation
const HASH_BATCH_SIZE = 100;  // Process 100 hashes per batch
const CPU_USAGE_DELAY = {     // CPU usage control
  25: 300,   // 25% CPU = 300ms delay between batches
  50: 150,   // 50% CPU = 150ms delay
  75: 50,    // 75% CPU = 50ms delay  
  100: 0     // 100% CPU = no delay
};
```

### **Polyfill Configuration (Critical)**
```javascript
// craco.config.js - Required for crypto libraries
module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    configure: {
      resolve: {
        fallback: {
          "buffer": require.resolve("buffer"),
          "process": require.resolve("process/browser"),
          "util": require.resolve("util")
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### **Service Management Commands**
```bash
# Restart all services
sudo supervisorctl restart all

# Check service status
sudo supervisorctl status

# View logs for debugging
tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log
```

### **Testing Protocol**
```bash
# Always test backend first
deep_testing_backend_v2 "Test wallet mining system"

# Then ask user before frontend testing
ask_human "Should I proceed with frontend testing?"

# Update test_result.md with findings
# Document all fixes and improvements
```
