```

#### CPU Mining Optimization:
```bash
# Set CPU governor
echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# Disable CPU mitigations for performance
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="mitigations=off"
```

### 🎯 Mining Rewards Distribution

#### Fee Redistribution Benefits:
Mining WEPO is more profitable than traditional cryptocurrencies because miners receive:

1. **Block Rewards**: Standard mining rewards per 6-month schedule
2. **Real-time Fee Share**: 25% of ALL network fees every block
3. **Transaction Fees**: 25% of all 0.0001 WEPO transaction fees
4. **RWA Creation Fees**: 25% of all 0.0002 WEPO asset creation fees
5. **Network Operations**: 25% of all other network fees

**Plus, when mining ends (Month 19), you can:**
- **Become a Masternode**: 10,000 WEPO collateral → 60% of all fees
- **Stake WEPO**: Any amount → 15% of all fees (proportional)

**No fees are ever burned - 100% goes to network participants!**
