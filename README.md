## ⛏️ Mining Guide

### Mining Algorithm: Argon2
WEPO uses **Argon2** - a memory-hard, ASIC-resistant mining algorithm that ensures fair distribution and prevents mining centralization.

### Mining Rewards:
- **Months 1-6**: 400 WEPO per block (~$TBD)
- **Months 7-12**: 200 WEPO per block  
- **Months 13-18**: 100 WEPO per block
- **Month 19+**: PoS/Masternode transition
- **PLUS**: 25% of ALL network fees go to current block miner!
- **ADDITIONAL**: Real-time fee distribution every block

3. **WEPO-CPUMiner** (CPU Only)
   ```bash
   ./wepo-cpuminer -a argon2d -o stratum+tcp://pool1.wepo.network:4444 -u YOUR_WEPO_ADDRESS
   ```

### 🖥️ Hardware Requirements

#### Minimum Requirements:
- **CPU**: 4 cores, 2.0+ GHz
- **RAM**: 8GB DDR4 (Argon2 is memory-intensive)
- **Storage**: 100GB SSD (for blockchain data)
- **Network**: Stable internet connection

#### Recommended for Profitability:
- **CPU**: 16+ cores, 3.0+ GHz (AMD Ryzen 9, Intel i9)
- **RAM**: 32GB+ DDR4-3200
- **GPU**: RTX 4080/4090, RX 7800/7900 series
- **Storage**: 500GB+ NVMe SSD

#### Enterprise Mining:
- **CPU**: Dual EPYC/Xeon servers
- **RAM**: 128GB+ ECC memory
- **Multiple GPUs**: 8x RTX 4090 or similar
- **Network**: Redundant connections

### 🔧 Solo Mining Setup

#### Run Your Own WEPO Node:
```bash
cd wepo-blockchain
python -m core.wepo_node --mining --address YOUR_WEPO_ADDRESS
```

#### Mining Configuration:
```json
{
  "mining_enabled": true,
  "miner_address": "wepo1your32characteraddresshere12345",
  "mining_threads": 16,
  "memory_usage": "auto",
  "network": "mainnet"
}
```

### 📊 Mining Profitability

#### Factors Affecting Profitability:
- **Hash Rate**: Your mining power (H/s)
- **Network Difficulty**: Adjusts every 2016 blocks
- **Hardware Efficiency**: Performance per watt
- **Electricity Cost**: Major operational expense
- **WEPO Price**: Market value of mined coins
- **Fee Redistribution**: Additional income from network fees

#### Profitability Calculator:
```
Daily WEPO = (Your Hashrate / Network Hashrate) × Daily Block Rewards
Daily Fees = (Your Hashrate / Network Hashrate) × Daily Fee Pool
Total Daily = Daily WEPO + Daily Fees
```

### 🛠️ Mining Setup Tutorial

#### Step 1: Create WEPO Wallet
```bash
# Run WEPO wallet
cd frontend && yarn start
# Create new wallet and copy address
```

#### Step 2: Download Mining Software
```bash
# Official miner
wget https://github.com/wepo-network/releases/wepo-miner-v1.0.tar.gz
tar -xzf wepo-miner-v1.0.tar.gz
cd wepo-miner
```

#### Step 3: Configure Miner
```bash
# Edit config.json
{
  "pool_url": "stratum+tcp://pool1.wepo.network:4444",
  "wallet_address": "wepo1your32characteraddresshere12345",
  "worker_name": "miner01",
  "threads": 16
}
```

#### Step 4: Start Mining
```bash
./wepo-miner --config config.json
```

### 🔐 Mining Security

#### Best Practices:
- **Secure Wallet**: Keep private keys offline
- **Pool Selection**: Choose reputable pools
- **Monitoring**: Track hashrate and earnings
- **Updates**: Keep mining software current
- **Backup**: Secure wallet seed phrases

#### Avoid Common Mistakes:
- ❌ Using untrusted mining software
- ❌ Mining to exchange addresses
- ❌ Ignoring temperature monitoring
- ❌ Overclocking without proper cooling

### 📈 Advanced Mining

#### GPU Mining Optimization:
```bash
# NVIDIA settings
nvidia-smi -pl 250  # Power limit
nvidia-settings -a GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset[3]=1000

# AMD settings  
echo "manual" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_force_performance_level
```

#### CPU Mining Optimization:
```bash
# Set CPU governor
echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# Disable CPU mitigations for performance
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="mitigations=off"
```

### 🎯 Mining Rewards Distribution

#### Fee Redistribution Benefits:
Mining WEPO is more profitable than traditional cryptocurrencies because miners receive:

1. **Block Rewards**: Standard mining rewards per 6-month schedule
2. **Real-time Fee Share**: 25% of ALL network fees every block
3. **Transaction Fees**: 25% of all 0.0001 WEPO transaction fees
4. **RWA Creation Fees**: 25% of all 0.0002 WEPO asset creation fees
5. **Network Operations**: 25% of all other network fees

**Plus, when mining ends (Month 19), you can:**
- **Become a Masternode**: 10,000 WEPO collateral → 60% of all fees
- **Stake WEPO**: Any amount → 15% of all fees (proportional)

**No fees are ever burned - 100% goes to network participants!**
