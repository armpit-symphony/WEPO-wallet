3. Edit upload-and-deploy.sh with your server IP
4. Run deployment script
5. Test live network
```

### **2. GitHub Distribution (You)**
**Time Required**: 15 minutes

```bash
# Steps:
1. Create GitHub repository: wepo-desktop-wallet
2. Upload /app/wepo-desktop-wallet/ contents
3. Create release with wepo-desktop-wallet-v1.0.0.tar.gz
4. Users download and run start-wallet.bat
```

### **3. iOS Development (Next Engineer)**
**Time Required**: 3-4 months  
**Deliverable**: TestFlight beta app

```bash
# Next engineer has:
- Complete handoff document (/app/WEPO_iOS_HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md)

## 👩‍💻 Engineer-to-Engineer Communication (Latest Changes)

- Pre-Genesis UX: Non-blocking banners removed; Send WEPO/Vault disabled; BTC usable; Mining allows early connect
- Dashboard: 8-tile grid order (Send, Receive, PoW, PoS, Vault, Messaging, Settings, Logout)
- PoS: Button visible with "Activates at Block 131,400"; opens StakingInterface (not yet active)
- Settings (staging-only controls):
  - Simulate PoW / Simulate Pre-Genesis → POST /api/mining/_toggle_genesis
  - BTC relay controls: checkbox "Relay BTC via Masternodes only" (sessionStorage: btc_relay_only)
  - Show Last BTC Relay (reads sessionStorage btc_last_relay_status)
- BTC Masternode Relay (self-custodial preserved):
  - POST /api/bitcoin/relay/broadcast { rawtx, relay_only }
  - GET /api/bitcoin/relay/status
  - Broadcast wired in frontend (SelfCustodialBitcoinWallet.js)
- Security: Full Prelaunch Security Suite re-run → 87/100 (GO)
- Testing: Frontend suite passed (dashboard, mining connect, PoS view, vault modal, settings block height, security headers)

### Staging Test Notes
- REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL used for all frontend API calls (no hardcoding)
- Genesis flip is staging-only and should be removed or gated for production
- BTC init/sync endpoints are placeholders to unblock UI; replace with real indexer integration when ready
