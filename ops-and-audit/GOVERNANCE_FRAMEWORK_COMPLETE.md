## 🎯 **GOVERNANCE WORKFLOW EXAMPLE**

### **1. Proposal Phase**
```
Community Member → Create Proposal → Review → Bond 10,000 WEPO → Submit
```

```
Proposer → Activate Proposal → 5-minute preparation → Voting Begins
```

### **3. Voting Phase (2 weeks)**
```
Masternodes (10x power) + Stakers (1x/1000 WEPO) → Cast Votes → Track Results
```

### **4. Decision Phase**
```
Check Participation (≥20%) → Check Approval (≥60%) → Pass/Reject Decision
```

### **5. Execution Phase**
```
Execution Delay (24-48 hours) → Automatic Implementation → Network Update
```
