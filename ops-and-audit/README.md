## üéØ **PURPOSE & MISSION**

This directory serves as the **central knowledge hub** for maintaining continuity between engineers working on the WEPO project. It preserves:

- **Shortcuts and optimizations** learned during development
- **Strategic planning items** for economic and technical evolution
- **Critical security concerns** that need ongoing attention
- **Comprehensive task lists** with clear priorities
- **Implementation patterns** that work well

## üìä **CURRENT PROJECT STATUS**

### **‚úÖ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS**
1. **TRUE End-to-End Encryption**: Messaging system provides genuine privacy
2. **Hybrid PoW/PoS Consensus**: Fully operational after 18 months
3. **Revolutionary Masternode Services**: 5 genuine services justify 60% fees
4. **Self-Custodial Wallet**: Users maintain full control of funds

### **üö® CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**
1. **Wallet Authentication Flow**: Users cannot access dashboard after wallet creation
2. **Masternode-Wallet Integration**: Services not fully integrated with wallet interface
3. **Economic Adjustments**: Need dynamic collateral system for WEPO value appreciation

## üîß **HOW TO USE THIS DIRECTORY**

### **FOR INCOMING ENGINEERS**
1. **Start with**: `CONTINUITY_GUIDE.md` - Learn shortcuts and patterns
2. **Review**: `TODO_LIST.md` - Understand current priorities
3. **Study**: `STRATEGIC_PLANNING.md` - Grasp long-term vision
4. **Check**: `SECURITY_CONCERNS.md` - Understand security landscape

### **FOR ONGOING DEVELOPMENT**
1. **Update TODO_LIST.md** when completing tasks
2. **Add new shortcuts** to CONTINUITY_GUIDE.md
3. **Revise strategic planning** as market conditions change
4. **Document new security concerns** as they arise

## üé® **DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS**

### **File Naming Convention**
- `CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md` for main documentation
- Clear, descriptive names
- Consistent formatting and structure

### **Content Standards**
- **Priority levels**: üî• CRITICAL, üî¥ HIGH, üü° MEDIUM, üü¢ LOW
- **Status indicators**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE, ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL, ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code examples** for technical items
- **Implementation timelines** for planning items

## üöÄ **ENGINEER HANDOFF PROTOCOL**

### **WHEN STARTING WORK**
1. Read all files in this directory
2. Update TODO_LIST.md with current status
3. Add any new shortcuts learned to CONTINUITY_GUIDE.md
4. Review strategic planning items for current relevance

### **WHEN COMPLETING WORK**
1. Update completion status in TODO_LIST.md
2. Document new patterns in CONTINUITY_GUIDE.md
3. Add any new security concerns discovered
4. Update strategic planning based on progress

### **WHEN HANDING OFF**
1. Ensure all files are current
2. Add summary of work completed
3. Highlight any new critical issues discovered
4. Update priorities based on current state

## üìà **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Knowledge Preservation**
- **Shortcuts documented**: Prevent re-learning same optimizations
- **Patterns established**: Consistent development approaches
- **Pitfalls recorded**: Avoid repeating same mistakes

### **Strategic Planning**
- **Economic adjustments planned**: Maintain network accessibility
- **Technical roadmap clear**: Structured development approach
- **Security priorities set**: Systematic security improvements

### **Project Continuity**
- **Smooth handoffs**: Minimal learning curve for new engineers
- **Consistent progress**: Building on previous work effectively
- **Quality maintenance**: Preserving code quality and patterns

## üîí **SECURITY REMINDER**

This directory contains sensitive strategic planning information. While it should be preserved for continuity, be mindful of:

- **Strategic information** that could affect market perception
- **Security vulnerabilities** that need careful handling
- **Economic planning** that could impact WEPO value

## üéØ **PRIORITY FOCUS FOR NEXT ENGINEER**

### **IMMEDIATE (Next 2 weeks)**
1. **Fix wallet authentication flow** - Critical for user experience
2. **Complete masternode-wallet integration** - Essential for usability
3. **Audit self-custodial wallet** - Security and compliance requirement

### **SHORT-TERM (Next 2 months)**
1. **Implement dynamic collateral system** - Critical for network scaling
2. **Add price oracle integration** - Foundation for economic adjustments
3. **Complete comprehensive testing** - Production readiness

### **MEDIUM-TERM (Next 6 months)**
1. **Implement real Dilithium2** - True quantum resistance
2. **Upgrade to production zk-STARK** - Enhanced security
3. **Build governance system** - Community-driven evolution
