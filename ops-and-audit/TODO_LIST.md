# 🚨 WEPO TODO LIST - CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES REQUIRED

## ⚠️ URGENT: Christmas Day 2025 Launch BLOCKED - Immediate Action Required

**Date:** December 2024  
**Security Score:** 44.2% (FAILED - Requires 85%+ for cryptocurrency production)  
**Status:** 🚨 CRITICAL - Launch blocked by security vulnerabilities  
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE - Security fixes required for production launch  

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY (Launch Blockers) 

### 1. FIX SLOWAPI RATE LIMITING INTEGRATION 
**Status:** ❌ BROKEN - 0% Success Rate  
**Issue:** @limiter.limit() decorators not working despite implementation  
**Impact:** No rate limiting = vulnerable to DDoS attacks  
**Files:** `/app/definitive_security_fix.py`, `/app/wepo-fast-test-bridge.py`  

**Debug Steps:**
- [ ] Verify SlowAPIMiddleware is registered correctly
- [ ] Check if limiter object is attached to app.state
- [ ] Test @limiter.limit() decorators on endpoints
- [ ] Verify HTTP 429 responses are generated
- [ ] Test rate limiting headers inclusion

**Expected Result:** HTTP 429 after exceeding limits (Global: 60/min, Login: 5/min, Create: 3/min)

### 2. FIX BRUTE FORCE PROTECTION ACCOUNT LOCKOUT
**Status:** ❌ BROKEN - 50% Success Rate  
**Issue:** 6th login attempt returns HTTP 401 instead of HTTP 423  
**Impact:** Unlimited login attempts = wallet compromise risk  
**Files:** `/app/definitive_security_fix.py`, login endpoint integration  

**Debug Steps:**
- [ ] Verify failed_login_storage persists across requests  
- [ ] Test check_account_lockout() method integration
- [ ] Check record_failed_attempt() storage updates
- [ ] Verify HTTP 423 response generation after 5 attempts
- [ ] Test lockout duration enforcement (5 minutes)

**Expected Result:** HTTP 423 "Account locked" after 5 failed login attempts

### 3. ACHIEVE 85%+ SECURITY SCORE FOR PRODUCTION
**Status:** ❌ FAILED - Currently 44.2%  
**Target:** 85%+ required for cryptocurrency production standards  
**Testing:** Run `/app/definitive_security_test.py` to verify fixes  

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Brute Force Protection: 100% (4/4 tests pass)
- [ ] Rate Limiting: 100% (5/5 tests pass)  
- [ ] SlowAPI Integration: 100% (3/3 tests pass)
- [ ] Overall Security Score: 85%+ 
- [ ] No regressions in working security features
