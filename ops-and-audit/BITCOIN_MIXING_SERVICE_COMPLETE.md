## 🌊 **MIXING POOL MECHANICS**

### **Pool Formation Process**
1. **Request Submission**: User submits mixing request with amount and privacy level
2. **Pool Assignment**: System finds or creates appropriate mixing pool
3. **Participant Gathering**: Pool waits for minimum participants (3-8 depending on type)
4. **Mixing Initiation**: Once minimum reached, mixing rounds begin
5. **Privacy Enhancement**: Multiple rounds of transaction obfuscation
6. **Completion**: Mixed coins delivered to user's self-custodial address

### **Privacy Techniques**
- **CoinJoin-Style Mixing**: Multiple inputs/outputs make tracking difficult
- **Multi-Round Processing**: 1-5 rounds of mixing for enhanced privacy
- **Amount Standardization**: Fixed tiers prevent amount-based tracking
- **Temporal Obfuscation**: Variable delays to prevent timing analysis
- **Masternode Distribution**: Different masternodes for different rounds

### **Security Features**
- **No Custody**: Masternodes coordinate but never hold user funds
- **Quantum-Resistant**: Framework ready for post-quantum cryptography
- **Reputation System**: Mixer quality tracking and community oversight
- **Transparent Process**: All mixing statistics publicly available
