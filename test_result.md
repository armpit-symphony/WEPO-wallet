# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

✅ All APIs consistent - No user confusion
✅ Christmas Day 2025 launch ready with special commemorative Genesis reward
✅ Historic significance preserved with 400 WEPO Genesis block

**Technical Changes Made**:
- Added special case for Genesis Block (height == 0) = 400 WEPO commemorative
- Regular mining (height >= 1) follows tokenomics = 52.51 WEPO
- Updated reward schedule display to show Genesis special case
- Added "genesis_special" field explaining commemorative reward
- Phase naming includes Christmas Day significance

**Status**: 🎉 PRIORITY 3 ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED + GENESIS BLOCK PERFECTED

Buffer, process, and React globals are all undefined in browser. Root element remains empty. **TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**: The issue appears to be that crypto libraries (bip39, crypto-js) in WalletContext.js are trying to use Buffer before the polyfills are properly loaded. The webpack polyfill configuration is not working as expected. **IMPACT**: Cannot test any privacy mixing UI features as requested in the review: Privacy Controls UI Testing, Enhanced Unified Exchange Interface Testing, Privacy-Enhanced Swap Flow Testing, Real-time Mixing Status Display Testing, Bitcoin-backed RWA Privacy Integration Testing, Enhanced Security & User Experience Testing. **CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION**: This is a fundamental build system issue that requires main agent intervention.

CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND: ❌ **Atomic Swap Initiation** - /api/atomic-swap/initiate returning 500 errors, preventing swap creation and blocking all subsequent swap operations (status, funding, proof). ❌ **RWA Trading Endpoints Missing** - /api/rwa/tokens and /api/rwa/rates returning 404 Not Found, indicating RWA trading endpoints not properly integrated. ❌ **Exchange Rate Consistency** - RWA rates endpoint not accessible, preventing unified exchange rate validation. CONCLUSION: The unified exchange interface has partial functionality with exchange rates working correctly and fee redistribution properly implemented. However, critical trading operations (swap initiation, RWA trading) are not functional, preventing complete trading workflows. The 3-way fee redistribution system is correctly implemented and the zero burning policy is confirmed."

TESTING SCOPE COVERED: 1) **Mining Schedule Verification** - Testing calculate_block_reward function with various block heights for all phases (Phase 1: 52.51 WEPO, Phase 2A: 33.17 WEPO, Phase 2B: 16.58 WEPO, Phase 2C: 8.29 WEPO, Phase 2D: 4.15 WEPO, Post-PoW: 0 WEPO) 2) **Total Supply Consistency** - Verifying all endpoints return 69,000,003 WEPO 3) **Tokenomics API** - Testing /api/tokenomics endpoint for 20-year schedule information 4) **Mining Info API** - Testing /api/mining/info and related endpoints 5) **Staking System** - Testing staking activation and fee distribution 6) **Network Status** - Verifying /api/network/status shows correct information. RESULTS: ✅ 2/6 tests passed (33.3% success rate). WORKING FEATURES: ✅ **Staking System** - /api/staking/activate working correctly, staking activation functional (50% success) ✅ **Network Status** - Most network status fields working correctly including blockchain ready status, block height, and difficulty (80% success). CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND: ❌ **Mining Schedule Verification** - While mining info endpoint accessible, tokenomics overview missing phase information for new 20-year schedule (78.3% success) ❌ **Total Supply Consistency** - ALL endpoints returning 63,900,006 WEPO instead of expected 69,000,003 WEPO (0% success) ❌ **Tokenomics API** - /api/tokenomics/overview missing critical data: incorrect total supply (63,900,006 vs 69,000,003) and missing fee redistribution information (0% success) ❌ **Mining Info API** - /api/mining/info working but /api/mining/schedule has invalid structure, missing current_status and mining_phases (50% success). CONCLUSION: The WEPO 20-year tokenomics implementation has CRITICAL ISSUES that need immediate attention. The most significant problem is the incorrect total supply (63,900,006 vs 69,000,003) across all endpoints, indicating the new tokenomics values haven't been properly updated in the system. The mining schedule verification shows the endpoints exist but lack the new 20-year phase structure. The fee redistribution information is completely missing from the tokenomics API. These issues must be resolved before the new sustainable mining schedule can be considered functional."

BACKEND API STATUS: ✅ All RWA backend APIs are working correctly (/api/rwa/fee-info, /api/rwa/statistics, /api/rwa/tokens/tradeable all return proper responses). FRONTEND COMPONENT STATUS: ✅ RWADashboard.js, RWACreateAsset.js, and EnhancedDEX.js components are properly implemented with enhanced loading logic, debug logging, better error handling, and fallback wallet address detection as described in the fixes. CRITICAL BLOCKER: Despite the main agent's fixes to the RWA Dashboard component loading logic, users cannot test these fixes because they cannot reach the dashboard due to the broken authentication flow. The wallet daemon service failure is preventing successful wallet creation and login. RECOMMENDATION: Fix the wepo-walletd service asyncio event loop issue to restore authentication functionality, then the RWA Dashboard loading fixes can be properly tested."

TESTING SCOPE COVERED: 1) **Create Multi-Asset Quantum Vault** - Testing vault with WEPO and RWA support 2) **RWA Token Deposit** - Privacy-protected RWA token storage 3) **RWA Asset Listing** - Private portfolio display 4) **RWA Ghost Transfer Initiation** - Untraceable RWA transfers 5) **RWA Token Withdrawal** - Privacy-protected withdrawals 6) **Multi-Asset Vault Status** - Enhanced vault information. RESULTS: ❌ 0/6 tests passed (0% success rate). CRITICAL FINDINGS: ✅ **Basic Quantum Vault Creation Works** - /api/vault/create endpoint functional, creates vaults with privacy commitments and vault IDs ✅ **Basic Vault Status Works** - /api/vault/status/{vault_id} returns vault information with privacy level and transaction count. MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION GAPS: ❌ **RWA-Specific Endpoints Missing** - All RWA Quantum Vault endpoints return 404 Not Found: /api/vault/rwa/deposit, /api/vault/rwa/assets/{vault_id}, /api/vault/rwa/ghost-transfer/initiate, /api/vault/rwa/withdraw ❌ **Multi-Asset Support Not Implemented** - Vault creation response lacks multi_asset_support, rwa_support, and rwa_ghost_transfers fields ❌ **Enhanced Vault Status Missing** - Vault status lacks total_assets, asset_types, assets portfolio information, and revolutionary features like asset_type_hiding ❌ **RWA Integration Not Found** - No evidence of RWA tokenization integration with Quantum Vault privacy system. CONCLUSION: While the basic Quantum Vault system exists and works correctly for WEPO storage with privacy protection, the revolutionary RWA integration features described in the review request are NOT IMPLEMENTED. The 'world's first private real-world asset storage solution' combining RWA tokenization with Quantum Vault privacy does not exist in the current codebase. The system needs: 1) Implementation of all RWA-specific vault endpoints 2) Multi-asset vault architecture supporting both WEPO and RWA tokens 3) RWA ghost transfer system with asset type hiding 4) Enhanced vault status with portfolio privacy features 5) Integration between existing RWA tokenization system and Quantum Vault privacy."

    message: "🎉 COMPREHENSIVE RWA FEE REDISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY! Conducted extensive testing of the updated RWA fee redistribution system with 100% success rate (8/8 tests passed). The major change from burning WEPO coins to redistributing fees to network participants has been successfully implemented and tested. CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA MET: ✅ 1. Fee Redistribution Policy - API correctly shows redistribution policy instead of burn policy, with proper first 18 months (miners) and after 18 months (masternodes) distribution policies, and clear 'No coins are burned' statement. ✅ 2. Redistribution Pool System - Pool working correctly, tracking total collected fees (0.0006 WEPO accumulated during testing), distribution history, and policy information. ✅ 3. Fee Collection - Fees properly collected in redistribution pool instead of being burned, with correct 0.0002 WEPO fee amount per RWA asset creation. ✅ 4. Fee Accumulation - Multiple asset fees accumulate correctly in the pool (tested with 3 assets creating 0.0006 WEPO total). ✅ 5. Miner Distribution - Successfully distributed accumulated fees to miner address, with proper pool reduction and distribution tracking. ✅ 6. Masternode Distribution - Successfully distributed fees equally among multiple masternode addresses (tested with 3 masternodes receiving equal shares). ✅ 7. Distribution History - Complete distribution history properly tracked with block heights, recipients, amounts, types (miner_reward/masternode_reward), and timestamps. ✅ 8. API Response Updates - All API responses now reflect redistribution instead of burning, with messages like 'Fee will be redistributed to network participants' instead of burn references. The RWA fee redistribution system successfully ensures tokenomics sustainability by rewarding network participants instead of permanently reducing WEPO supply. This ensures the tokenomics are sustainable and network participants are properly rewarded instead of permanently reducing WEPO supply."

AUTHENTICATION FIXES STATUS: ✅ 1. **Wallet Creation Flow FIXED**: Users can now successfully complete wallet setup without getting stuck. The wallet mode selector loads correctly, form validation works properly, seed phrase backup displays correctly with 12-word mnemonic, and the entire process completes successfully with proper auto-login. ✅ 2. **Auto-login After Wallet Setup WORKS PERFECTLY**: Critical fix confirmed working - users are automatically logged into the dashboard immediately after completing wallet creation. The 'Setup complete' log shows autoLogin: true, and users land directly on the dashboard with proper session management. ✅ 3. **Session Persistence WORKS**: Users stay logged in after page refresh, browser navigation works correctly, and authentication state is properly maintained across sessions using localStorage and sessionStorage. ✅ 4. **Authentication State Management WORKS**: Proper handling of wallet existence flags, session tokens, and seamless transitions between authentication states. Debug logs show correct state tracking throughout the flow. RWA DASHBOARD ACCESS ISSUE IDENTIFIED: ❌ 5. **RWA Dashboard Component Loading FAILURE**: While the 'RWA Tokens' button with NEW badge is visible and clickable in the dashboard, clicking it triggers a loading spinner that gets stuck indefinitely. The RWA Dashboard component fails to render, showing only a loading state. This appears to be a component loading/rendering issue rather than a navigation or authentication problem. CONCLUSION: The authentication flow fixes are highly successful and completely resolve the critical user experience issues that were blocking access to the dashboard. Users can now create wallets, get auto-logged in, and access the main dashboard reliably. However, there's a separate issue with the RWA Dashboard component itself failing to load/render properly, which prevents users from accessing RWA features despite successful authentication."

Fee Distribution to Miners - Accumulated fees are successfully distributed to miners with proper pool clearing. ✅ 3. Complete Fee Flow - RWA fees flow correctly through the system (creation → pool → distribution → miners). ✅ 4. Wallet Setup and Funding - Test infrastructure working correctly. CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND: ❌ 1. Normal Transaction Fee Redistribution NOT IMPLEMENTED - Normal transaction fees (0.0001 WEPO) are NOT being added to the redistribution pool. Transactions are processed but fees are not collected for redistribution. ❌ 2. Missing Normal Transaction Redistribution Info - The /api/rwa/fee-info endpoint does not include 'normal_transaction_redistribution' information as required. ❌ 3.
