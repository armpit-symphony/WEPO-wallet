# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

While error responses are sometimes wrapped in 500 status codes instead of returning direct 400/404 codes, the validation logic itself is working correctly. The blockchain now maintains proper UTXO management throughout transaction flows, ensuring balance integrity is preserved."

The /api/privacy/info endpoint correctly reports privacy features (zk-STARK proofs, Ring signatures, Confidential transactions, Stealth addresses), privacy levels (standard, high, maximum), and proof sizes. Privacy proof generation via /api/privacy/create-proof works correctly, creating valid zk-STARK proofs. Proof verification via /api/privacy/verify-proof successfully validates legitimate proofs, but has an issue with not properly rejecting invalid proofs. Stealth address generation via /api/privacy/stealth-address works perfectly, creating valid stealth addresses with proper shared secrets. Transaction privacy integration has issues - sending transactions with privacy_level parameter returns 500 errors, indicating integration problems between the privacy engine and transaction processing. Overall, the core cryptographic privacy features are implemented correctly, but there are integration issues with the transaction system that need to be addressed."
