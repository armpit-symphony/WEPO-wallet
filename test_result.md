# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "üö® CRITICAL RWA FRONTEND INTEGRATION FAILURE: Conducted comprehensive testing of the RWA tokenization system frontend and discovered major accessibility issues. BACKEND STATUS: ‚úÖ All RWA API endpoints are fully functional (/api/rwa/fee-info correctly returns 0.0002 WEPO fee structure, /api/rwa/tokens/tradeable works, /api/dex/rate operational with RWA token support). FRONTEND CRITICAL ISSUES: ‚ùå 1. **Wallet Creation Flow Completely Broken**: Users cannot complete wallet setup - the application gets stuck in the seed phrase backup screen and continuously returns to wallet selection, preventing any access to the main dashboard where RWA features would be located. ‚ùå 2. **RWA Dashboard Completely Inaccessible**: The 'RWA Tokens' button with NEW badge that should provide access to the RWA system is not visible in the main dashboard, making the entire RWA tokenization system unreachable by end users. ‚ùå 3. **Component Integration Missing**: While RWADashboard.js, RWACreateAsset.js, and EnhancedDEX.js components exist with complete RWA functionality (asset creation wizard, fee validation, file upload, tokenization flow, DEX integration), they are not properly integrated with the main App.js routing system. ‚ùå 4. **Session Management Failure**: Wallet sessions don't persist correctly, causing users to be constantly redirected back to wallet selection screen. IMPACT: Despite having a fully functional RWA tokenization backend with economic spam prevention (0.0002 WEPO fee), comprehensive asset management capabilities, cross-wallet support, and DEX integration, the system is completely unusable by end users due to broken wallet setup and navigation. The RWA system needs immediate frontend integration fixes to make these revolutionary features accessible."

    message: "üéØ COMPREHENSIVE FEE REDISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETED - PARTIAL SUCCESS: Conducted extensive testing of the updated fee redistribution system that includes normal transaction fees. RESULTS: ‚úÖ 4/8 tests passed (50% success rate). WORKING FEATURES: ‚úÖ 1. RWA Fee Redistribution - RWA creation fees (0.0002 WEPO) are correctly collected and redistributed to network participants instead of being burned. ‚úÖ 2. Fee Distribution to Miners - Accumulated fees are successfully distributed to miners with proper pool clearing. ‚úÖ 3. Complete Fee Flow - RWA fees flow correctly through the system (creation ‚Üí pool ‚Üí distribution ‚Üí miners). ‚úÖ 4. Wallet Setup and Funding - Test infrastructure working correctly. CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND: ‚ùå 1. Normal Transaction Fee Redistribution NOT IMPLEMENTED - Normal transaction fees (0.0001 WEPO) are NOT being added to the redistribution pool. Transactions are processed but fees are not collected for redistribution. ‚ùå 2. Missing Normal Transaction Redistribution Info - The /api/rwa/fee-info endpoint does not include 'normal_transaction_redistribution' information as required. ‚ùå 3. Incomplete Fee Types in Pool Info - The /api/rwa/redistribution-pool endpoint does not list 'Normal transaction fees' in the fee_types_included array. ‚ùå 4. Missing Fee Redistribution Philosophy - The redistribution pool info is missing the comprehensive 'fee_redistribution_philosophy' field. CONCLUSION: The RWA fee redistribution system is working correctly, but the NORMAL TRANSACTION FEE REDISTRIBUTION is not implemented. Only RWA creation fees are being redistributed, while normal transaction fees are still being lost/burned instead of supporting network participants. This is a critical gap in the comprehensive fee redistribution system."
